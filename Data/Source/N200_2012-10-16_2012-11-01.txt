Yes. Absolutely.? Prostitution will never go away, and legalizing it will make it safer for both the prostitutes and their customers.? It can be regulated and taxed, which helps the economy.? There can be health regulation too, with regular checkups required.? Refusing to legalize the "world's oldest profession" is a head-in-the-sand approach.

Crying, this is about taking the guns out of violent gangs hands by dismantling their ability to make money. This is about putting women in a defensible position and about being able to track stds like never before. This is about decreasing the allure of prostitution by removing it from the list of forbidden fruits, and this is about the government making money off stupidity and infidelity. There are 0 downsides. Just look at Denmark, 40% decrease in VIOLENT street crime, not just the loss of prostitution, which wasn't a violent crime, in a short 10 years. Can you really counter argue that with anything other than "morals?"

I think any American that buys one of these cars are traitors. Until we can get Americans working at American companies again, we should purchase American made goods. As long as we let foreign companies push their JUNK here we are going to be at their mercy. Before you buy any more of their JUNK, stop and think "Do I really need that," and if you can get by without it, bank the money you would have spent and look for an American product. It will probably be better built and only slightly more expensive.

Peter, we're not arguing the age gap. we are arguing getting that drug money out of gang members hands! We are talking about dignifying the profession and making it safe! And no, it removes credibility from the gangs. forbidden fruit is a lot less attractive when it's no longer forbidden. And we are talking about bouncer-defended, indoor institutions where anyone who checks in can be contacted if an employee comes up with an std. It's the ultimate safeguard you ignoramous. No argument apart from relativity of morals can even be brought against legalization, regulation, and taxation of prostitution.

Oh, Ms. Nguyen, couples had better talk about sex!? People want to act like it will just flow with all the love.? No, it won't.? Women are programmed way different and the modern lifestyle and the two wage earner household has wrought havoc on the matter of intimacy.? Women are taking on more than they did decades ago, and are tired and far more independent, a lot less accomodating.? This should be discussed, the frequency, the variety, the level of desire, etc.? Most men are starving in this department and feel guilty even desiring their wives who see sex as just another demand on thier time and energy.? Men are forced to turn to other means of 'closeness' and or intimacy which brings its own dangers into a marriage or they become depressed feeling unwanted and guitly for even having the desire.? This is so important and should not be overlooked.? This man and most of his buddies can attest to this.? It is parodied on t.v. and in movies, but it is real and important.??Why do you think the pornography industry thrives the way it does.? Talk, sex and be clear and honest, but let the demonstration do most of the talking which to some is a moral issue, but it should not be skipped or taken for granted.

"Get any"? Get any what? This is an example of why it is dehumanizing. You are making the point of using a woman for her "parts".?How do you not see the degradation in that? Do you really believe most of these women choose this occupation because it's what they dreamed of becoming when they were little girls? And yes, they were "little girls" at one time and could very well? have been your little girls. Does that make any difference to you? Being your sister, your niece, your grand-daughter? Most prostitutes are streetwalkers - they are not escorts or high-priced call girls. Most enter into prostitution because they were sexually/physically abused as a child. Does this make you feel "like a man" to use one of these women?knowing that many have little choice when they sell themselves? Or are you so desperate that you don't even care?

We watch them come & go. I talked to an old man in his eighties. He said it was easy. He sold his home, cars, furniture and hit he road with his wife. You bill everything to your credit card. Pay it off every month.?Pull a little vehicle behind. Travel the north in the summer and head south in the winter. His wife died after 12 years but he?continues on fishing. Senior park passes discount a lot of money in overnight fees. A week or two in each place and a planned route. He said he always had a million dollar view.

Tabby...awesome story. Whoever decided to take care of these "ducks" should face animal cruelty charges but my guess is, if caught, they will not be held accountable because the town wanted the animals removed. Where I live a Wildlife Officer was shot and killed after stopping a person suspected of poaching deer. In an ironic twist, the park service later decided to dispose of the same deer population on the same day the?alleged?killer's court appearance made the front page. Rather ironic and a total oversight to report them inches apart if you ask me.

it is such a shame that this little boy had his friends killed, and hopefully the person or persons who did this will realize how they hurt an innocent child. That may never happen as there are a lot of just mean people who feel it is their right to do whatever they wish to do, no matter the consequences to the innocent. As for the parents, they need to go to the city officials and ask for their understanding and if they can get replacement animals. Some towns are allowing poultry as people have come to rely on the fresh eggs coming from a known source. In this case a possible case could be made that the child could be allowed replacement poultry given his needs as an autistic child. It would be very hard for the parents to explain to any child such a senseless act, and given his special needs just about impossible. It is up to the parents to do what they must with the help of people who understand the needs of this child. If the parents get the okay to get poultry again they must do everything possible to insure the chickens etc are females, no crowing roosters, and that they keep the pens clean and away from neighboring homes. A huge concern of city officials are the noise and smell of chickens that are not kept in clean pens and are allowed to fly, which can be curtailed with wing clipping. I do hope there can be a good solution, but wonder if it wouldn't be better to look into a therapy dog, which seems like a better choice than poultry, which no matter how clean, can carry diseases. just a thought.

People that have a strong faith tend to be happier and they tend to remain married longer, not sure that is a political statement.? However, polls have shown that Democrats tend to consider themselves Spiritual, but are less tied to a certain denomination and there are more athiests and agnostics among Democrats.? This would tend to suggest that for Democrats religion is of less importance than it is for Republicans.? Furthermore, a previous entry stated that Democrats are better educated.? Actually, educators tend to be Democrats, but Republicans tend to be better educated in the general populace.

What Romney is proposing sounds very similar to Reagan's " trickle down economics " where you give the break at the top and magically the middle class benefits with more job creation. Unfortunately, the rich just kept the extra savings. This policy did not work for Reagan and it won't work for Romney.\r\nI'll stand with Big Bird!

I recall how the VW Beetle initially turned the American car industry on its head. When folks were saying the same kind of things - oh it's junk, no one will buy it, etc - young people and people on limited budgets went out and bought them in droves. Why? Because they were a sturdy but basic cars and they were affordable. Soon, it became not only normal, but "cool" to own one. I would not go out now and buy a car for over $25K, which is what?current new compact cars now cost. However, I WOULD go and buy a reliable car for local transportation for under $10K. I think a LOT of students who need transportation and have $40K in student loans will buy them as well. As with the original Beetles, the only market resistance is that they ARE NOT AVAILABLE. ?Import them and we will buy them!? Let the snobs fork out a small home mortgage for a car. Give us inexpensive basic transport. Remember that even those $25-35K models are being recalled, so don;t tell me BS about "quality."

Tata Motors.\r\n? What will the Oil Companies do to stop it?\r\n It is an auto engine that runs on air. That's right; air not gas or diesel or electric but just the air around ... us. Take a look.\r\n Tata Motors of India has scheduled the Air Car to hit Indian streets by August 2012\r\n The Air Car, developed by ex-Formula One engineer Guy N. For Luxembourg-based MDI, uses compressed air to pu**** engine's pistons and make the car go.\r\n The Air Car, called the "Mini CAT" could cost around 365,757 rupees in India or $8,177 US.\r\n The Mini CAT which is a simple, light urban car, with a tubular chassis, a body of fiberglass that is glued not welded and powered by compressed air. A Microprocessor is used to control all electrical functions of the car. One tiny radio transmitter sends instructions to the lights, turn signals and every other electrical device on the car. Which are not many.\r\n The temperature of the clean air expelled by the exhaust pipe is between 0-15 degrees below zero, which makes it suitable for use by the internal air conditioning system with no need for gases or loss of power.\r\n There are no keys, just an access card which can be read by the car from your pocket. According to the designers, it costs less than 50 rupees (approx. $1.12 US) per 100 KM, that's about a tenth the cost of a car running on gas. It's mileage is about double that of the most advanced electric car, a factor which makes it a perfect choice for city motorists. The car has a top speed of 105 KM per hour or 60 mph and would have a range of around 300 km or 185 miles between refuels. Refilling the car will take place at adapted gas stations with special air compressors. A fill up will only take two to three minutes and costs approximately 100 rupees and the car will be ready to go another 300 kilometers.\r\n This car can also be filled at home with it's on board compressor. It will take 3-4 hours to refill the tank, but it can be done while you sleep. \r\n Because there is no combustion engine, changing the 1 liter of vegetable oil is only necessary every 50,000 KM or 30,000 miles. Due to its simplicity, there is very little maintenance to be done on this car.\r\n This Air Car almost sounds too good to be true. We'll see in August. 2012

Isn't prostitution already legal in Vegas?? Tax it like any other service, implement health inspections, and it becomes a winning situation for all concerned. Here are just some of the immediate benefits to legalized prostitution:? Better control of STDs (savings is less hospital space being used for treatment), keeping that many out of our overwhelmed jails and prisons (very costly), putting some (not all) pimps out of business, and the government makes money.? maybe it won't yield a profit, but the money generated could be used for other purposes.\r\n?\r\nIt won't eradicate the illegal side completely, but it could make a big difference.? Prostitution, legal or not, will never just go away, so instead of our government only spending money on trying to?arrest, prosecute, and punish, at?the very least the savings will be from not using other government resources.

You dimwits for Obama. Every tax ever passed gets paid by people buying. It doesn't matter if you make ten dollars or ten million. Businesses past the cost to the consumer. The Fed govt already taxes gas at 40 cents per gallon, if you raise taxes on gas it shows up in gas and everything else that requires gas to transport. Now lets also force interest rates near zero... this steals money from the seniors that have saved and invested for their future and only helps those who are in debt or want to borrow... Lets print more money. More money devalues money and causes the price of goods to go up, it's called inflation. Sorry, the govt does nothing to help people it only rewards the stupid and lazy. Nothing forces personal responsibility and change like pain. It's not pleasing to say but true. Without hard work and sacrifice there is no appreciation for what one has...

Geez, talk about clueless.? Think about it, people, this is obviously intended as a "watch-list" for girls, so they can avoid situations that put them at risk of rape.? It is saying, in effect, don't walk alone, don't leave your windows open, don't take a drink from a guy you just turned down for sex, etc.? It isn't a joke and it isn't a guide for rapists.? It is intended to help the girls put themselves in the mind and perspective of a rapist, so they can see that a situation that seems innocent and normal to them might actually be putting them at risk for being raped.? The part about doing lots of rapes to get better at it seems gratuitous, but it may be intended to convey the message that if a guy has a reputation for "not taking no for an answer" then you should probably not go to his room alone with him.? One would assume that would be automatic, but kids sometimes don't think the way adults do, so maybe you can't be too careful even with warning about the most obvious risk factors.

"If ever the U.S. were to rethink prostitution laws and regulations, they might look something like the law Sweden enacted in 1999. The Kvinnofrid law made it legal to sell sex but not to buy it. That is, prostitutes couldn¡¯t be charged with a crime but their clients would be charged, as would traffickers, pimps and brothel operators. "\r\n?\r\nWhat the heck sense does this idiotic law make? So now we're writing inequitable treatment into law (i.e. only the jons get prosecuted?)? Is that what?the feminazis and liberal wussy boys' idea of progress is?

Absolutely yes.? It's naive to think that men should be able to suppress their desires if they are unable to attract a woman.? Better to have them pay for the services of a willing professional who is routinely regulated by the state than to commit some sick sex crime with an innocent woman or child.\r\n?\r\nStreetwalkers, pimps, addicts, runaways, and predators now service this market, leading to addtional crimes, and the spreading of diseases.? Plus, they tie up the courts, the police and the jails.\r\n?\r\nControled prostitution, along with SEVERE penalties for pimps, etc.\r\n?\r\nWe need to get smart about this.

Well actually, you are very close.? There is no such thing as the 'love' they portray in Hollywood and in the music videos.\r\n\r\nLove is actually defined as, "The intentional and freely given act of working toward the well being of another."\r\n\r\nBasically, it is a decision.? One interesting biblical quote states, "Love your spouse."? In other words, it is a command that can be acted upon.? Something that you can be advised to do, and then decide to do.\r\n\r\nThose that say, "I want a divorce because I don't love him anymore" have no idea what love is.

I agree with your thought but someone already killed the others and they were fighting city/town officials to keep the animals. In other words, getting more may bring the same result. Rather stupid for the city to complain though, unless they were keeping a rooster or somehow the chickens wandered free. If I were the parents, I'd look into getting the kid something he could keep as a traditional pet. It is possible it would not have the same effect, but you can interact with a dog way more than you can a chicken. People really are the worst creatures on this planet.

Obey, correct, but that growth rate was not linear, the majority of it occurred before 2000, since then, the market has been very risky and not all that productive (some articles have called the 2001-2010 period the lost decade), and that raises the issue whether is makes sense for retirement funds to be placed there. We are not doing business in the same environment that we were 1980 to 1999, and just how trustworthy is Wall Street these days?.

God created teh chicken.? Then the chicken laid the egg.? Simple!\r\n?\r\nThanks for your apparent agreement on the elecion issue. I asked a local legislator recently a state government question.? He put the blame on the federal government saying they had to abide by federal regualations.? I am sure that is true, but I had to ask him what good state government is.? Of course, we need it! They need a full time salary for a part time job!!! If you are registered in or near Auburn, you may want to pick up a sample ballot before the election.? You can get those at your probage Judge's office or they can tell you where to pick one up.? There are several admendmenst on the ballot.? Read admendment nuber 8 carefully. It deals with legislator's salary!? When legislators vote themselves a 'median HOUSEHOLD income" for a partime job, it is time to vote against every one.? They will get a full time salary for 3 months work.? And, it isn't even based on an "individual's average income" but on a "household average income!"? Tell me that is not a rip0off!!!

"Another aspect of the biblical case for marriage that Mr. Vines does not address is the teaching of Jesus regarding marriage," Lenow observed.\r\n"In Matthew 19:3-12, Jesus is confronted by the Pharisees about marriage. While their question addresses the issue of divorce, Jesus answers them with his interpretation of God's design for marriage ¨C one man and one woman for life," said Lenow.\r\n"In verses 4-6, Jesus responds, 'Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, 'For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.' In this passage, Jesus affirms that God created male and female and that marriage is designed between one man and one woman ... Biblical marriage and biblical sexuality is heterosexual in nature according to Jesus himself." Read more at

He wasn't interupting , he was answering the question and she began to talk over him first, he just kept going because he was ready for her to try and cut him off. She got frustrated because she couldn't control the interview as it seemed she brought him on to try and make him look bad and couldn't. She was very condescending with the , "This is Hate Speech isn't it? ?If she wouldn't have been showing or implying a usually patronizing descent from dignity or superiority he wouldn't have had to keep talking to try and get his point in. By the way I don't necessarily agree with him, its just that I think she had an agenda to put him down and failed, so she ended the interview.

according to the bible no sin is above any other so excessive drinking, wearing clothes of different materials, tattoos, jealousy, laziness, greed, murder, being gay, and sex for not for?procreation's?purpose are all equal in the eyes of God. So shut your heathen sinning self up. So long as you have sinned in any manner you area sinner regardless of the sin. And all men are born with sin. You're just as much of a horrendous abomination of sin as ever gay man, murder, rapist, and thief there ever was. You no doubt have worn clothes of two different materials and that sin is just as destructive as homosexual pedophilia and rape and murder. You best repent or you might end up spending an eternity with a gay man...

She's half right, the Big Bang did create our universe, but BUT GOD CREATED THE BIG BANG? it happened ONLY BECAUSE GOD WILLED IT AND THEN HE MERELY SNAPPED HIS FINGERS!!!?? She is also wrong when she says it created our earth, God used the big bang to create our Universe, but obviously God also created our Earth after he created the universe!\r\n\r\nI laugh because I watched Stephen Hawkins video's hopelessly trying to disprove God, and it is comical how every conclusion that Hawkin makes points to God.? I'll give you an example in one of his shows Hawking discovers the dimension where there is timelessness, time doesn't exist there so there is no beginning or end.? Gee if Hawking wanted to find out that truth all he had to do was open his Bible and? look up God being the Alpha and the Omega, he has always existed. Many atheists make fun of the Bible saying that it is complete impossible? that God always has and always will exist, and then they discover that Steven Hawkin proves what the Christians have said about God being the Alpha and the Omega is fully supported by scientific fact....go figure.? So I find it comical that Stephen Hawkin actually proves something that he is trying in vain to disprove, HOW IRONIC IS THAT!? \r\n\r\np.s. The Holy Bible is the most produced book in human history, with over 9 billion produced, the second place finisher isn't even over 1 billion.? Think about that.......there is a reason why The Holy Bible is the most produced book in our human history it is the greatest book ever written!!!!

"A mother's life being in danger is a very rare occurrence?" Is this pastor stupid? What an Idiot! He'd rather let?dozens?of women die because their bodies cannot handle the process? Even if they did try to give birth to the child, you'd end up with both mother and child lost!? Is he a doctor? Does he know the innermost workings of conception and childbirth? What makes him think that childbirth is so simple?

She's half right, the Big Bang did create our universe, but BUT GOD CREATED THE BIG BANG? it happened ONLY BECAUSE GOD WILLED IT AND THEN HE MERELY SNAPPED HIS FINGERS!!!?? She is also wrong when she says it created our earth, God used the big bang to create our Universe, but obviously God also created our Earth after he created the universe!\r\n\r\nI laugh because I watched Stephen Hawkins video's hopelessly trying to disprove God, and it is comical how every conclusion that Hawkin makes points to God.? I'll give you an example in one of his shows Hawking discovers the dimension where there is timelessness, time doesn't exist there so there is no beginning or end.? Gee if Hawking wanted to find out that truth all he had to do was open his Bible and? look up God being the Alpha and the Omega, he has always existed. Many atheists make fun of the Bible saying that it is complete impossible? that God always has and always will exist, and then they discover that Steven Hawkin proves what the Christians have said about God being the Alpha and the Omega is fully supported by scientific fact....go figure.? So I find it comical that Stephen Hawkin actually proves something that he is trying in vain to disprove, HOW IRONIC IS THAT!? \r\n\r\np.s. The Holy Bible is the most produced book in human history, with over 9 billion produced, the second place finisher isn't even over 1 billion.? Think about that.......there is a reason why The Holy Bible is the most produced book in our human history it is the greatest book ever written!!!!

What Jasmin said is not true about homosexuality but this is............\r\nThe list of diseases found with extraordinary frequency among male homosexual practitioners as a result of **** intercourse is alarming: \r\n**** Cancer \r\nChlamydia trachomatis \r\nCryptosporidium \r\nGiardia lamblia \r\nHerpes simplex virus \r\nHuman immunodeficiency virus \r\nHuman papilloma virus \r\nIsospora belli \r\nMicrosporidia \r\nGonorrhea \r\nViral hepatitis types B & C \r\nSyphilis25 Sexual transmission of some of these diseases is so rare in the exclusively heterosexual population as to be virtually unknown. Others, while found among heterosexual and homosexual practitioners, are clearly predominated by those involved in homosexual activity.

Next the political correct folks are going to try to force us to accept bestiality, incest, and pedophilia, and homosexuality as being normal, instead of the evil and destructive and immoral sins that they are.? If you are a real Christian then you listen to God, you know the difference between right and wrong, and when they are trying to force sin and immorality upon you and your family you can tell them TO STICK IT WHERE THE SUN DON'T SHINE!

A) there was no genocide of the American Indians, that's all a Marxist myth that somehow became mainstream in America......look up all the historical massacres of Indians by whites, (not counting massacres of whites by Indians), and you'll get to less than 5,000 ever murdered in cold blood.? Wounded Knee, Sand Creek...and very few others.? Wounded Knee is debatable as to who caused it, Sand Creek was a crime, but contrary to later mythology, it was actually investigated as a crime by the US Congress at the time.??? The Holocaust was a genocide.? Nothing similar happened in America.? Not even to the most warlike tribes, who are all still around, Sioux, Apache, Comanche, and not even the most warlike leaders like Geronimo......got to live out all his days.\r\n\r\nB) Manifest Destiny doesn't mean anything bad......actually it referred to the pioneering effort out on the West and what seemed like our destiny to live in a great country and build a wonderful nation, which we did.

It is okay for you to criticize him, but you definitely should not make blatantly false comments about our president, whether that be Obama or Romney in 2013.

i do think it was an honest mistake. for one, it is right next to the date in english - i have been around a lot of first-generation latinos, they know people who know english, so they would have found this out sooner rather than later. it isn't like they put the wrong date in english and spanish, or didn't have it anywhere at all. that would be suspicious to me. but the way it looks, it is a simple typo. \r\n i mean, don't even get into typos here on the internet. how many times has "public" become "pubic" on signs? jay leno does this every monday night, the "headlines" segment, lots of them are typos. most are funny. it happens.

Oh, let's see, maybe the 3.9 million dollar home, or the 10.5 acres, or maybe keeping that big wife fed every hour or so, or maybe the slots, or maybe just plain stupid judgment. Either way, I think the lawsuit that they were in will be a continuation of the new lawsuit against them for the $600,00 dollars that they are in debt for. Get a planner when you inherit that much money. If you have no will power you will have no money power. What a waste. Now he will definitely be up the creek when it comes to a double lung transplant.

@Joseph, the 300 million was for the state departments budget as a whole.? It wasn't specified for security projects.? The other item brought up during the VP debate was the question why weren't the Marines there from the start?? The USMC provides embassy security throughout the world.? The cost for that security is not tied to the DOS.? The funding in question would have been used for private security, which is a another can of worms.? If you look at Afghanistan we are losing Soldiers due to this administration wanting to stay on a timeline.? The number of "friendly" fire incidents where Afghanistan security forces are killing US troops are on the rise.? US Soldiers have to rely on the locals to provide security for high level meetings putting their lives on the line needlessly.? Less than 1/3 of 1 percent of Americans choose to serve, we shouldnt throw their lives away for politics.

lets see, ever since Obama took office my healthcare coverage has tripled, gas has tripled a gallon of milk went up 3 bucks, and Obama gave out all them bailouts to so called green companies that are going bankrupt as we sit here and complain, and lets not forget the bank bailouts and the car company bailouts! The only reson these guys are trying to get in that office is to help out someone they know (friends/family). But where is our relief the real MIDDLE class (40,00to 90,000), those of us that get out there and bust our butts off 6 days a week. I see the free cell phone line every day, hell there was a lady on the news the other day that had 9 of them, and all that free help they get, I am half tempted to quit my job and go on welfare so they can pay rent and my gas and electric!!! But no I can not do that I was raised to work for what I want and if I can't afford it, I don't get!!!!!!!!!!!!! So go ahead and vote for either on of these guys, mark my word this country is going to fall HARD, our military, goverment and state are way to big for us middle class to pay for and why are we going into counties for a war that is not ours, protect our borders and waters, bring jobs back home, hell they just shut down bethsteel in Baltimore, for what to buy Chinese and japanese steel that both Obama and Rommney probrably have there dirty fingers in? Where is the person to represent us, THE REAL WORING CLASS and one more thing if you are a imagrent and not paying taxes? GO HOME TO YOUR COUNTRY we can't afford you any more

Hey Tarpaper great ideaof checking whitehouse.gov to bad to didn't, see clip below or go search for yourself "rose garden libya" will bring it up.? The use of of the word terror (not terrorism) was?used referring back to the 9/11 attacks but has nothing to do with Libya. He?only refers to actions as an attack. He did send more security after the attack but he still avoids answering why he turned down the request to send force before hand.?The President is a grade?A lier and?Democrats and the media have no problem backing him up with more lies.\r\n?\r\nOf course, yesterday was already a painful day for our nation as we marked the solemn memory of the 9/11 attacks. We mourned with the families who were lost on that day. I visited the graves of troops who made the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan at the hallowed grounds of Arlington Cemetery, and had the opportunity to say thank you and visit some of our wounded warriors at Walter Reed. And then last night, we learned the news of this attack in Benghazi. \r\n \r\nAs Americans, let us never, ever forget that our freedom is only sustained because there are people who are willing to fight for it, to stand up for it, and in some cases, lay down their lives for it. Our country is only as strong as the character of our people and the service of those both civilian and military who represent us around the globe.\r\n \r\nNo acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for. Today we mourn four more Americans who represent the very best of the United States of America. We will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act. And make no mistake, justice will be done.

"We have no freedom of speech" so I guess you should try speaking with your mouth empty. Smoking in a condo is putting your neighbors at risk for fire. The greatest danger in a fire is smoke inhalation , gases released in fire, ?which can travel far from the actual fire through the roof craw spaces and walls. Killing your neighbors. People react to problems by adding restrictions to reduce the demands on public services so your taxes can be more wisely used. I suggest you want greater freedom get away from people, the greater the number the fewer freedoms you will enjoy. Hey move to Idaho.

$250,000 a year in the rural Midwest is a lot different then $250,000 in most major metropolitan areas. States like NY & CA have high state tax raates which increases the cost of amny things including gasoline which have multiple layers of taxation.  \r\n? \r\nOne daughter works in downtown San Diego. Makes about $12.50 an hour. Parking costs $12 a day. $1,800 a month for a quasi ghetto 2 - bed apartment. It is a static number, whatever number you choose?does not reflect the actual cost of liviing from one place to the next. \r\n? \r\nRising tide lifts all boats, including government treasuries. Receding tides coupled with increase taxes on anyone drains the swamp. \r\n? \r\nWhen times get tough at your home, don't you cut expenses? Government is 'promoting' non-citizens to enroll in food stamp program. Increase from roughly 800,000 in 2008 to 1.63 million in 2012. Can we afford this? \r\n? \r\nNiece buys cigarrets beer and complains because she cannot afford to color in her newest tatoo with color. She's collecting welfare. Can we afford this?

It's less damaging to not release the taxes than to release them and allow the world to see what a tax cheat he is. \r\n? \r\nSo, Romney will show up with another pocket full of lies, because he knows that to the mindless minions that follow him, telling those lies goes much further than saying nothing at all.

I'm surprised no one brought up Obama throws another one under the bus. (Hillary). I can't take another 4 yrs of Obama playing golf and the Cow vacationing on taxpayers money . Get them out of the White House and get the country back to work. Obama also did cut drilling for oil , natural gas? on Federal land if you don't believe me just look at your next fuel bill. They have been cooking the numbers for the past year now esp. this month.\r\n?\r\nAnother funny thing the check spell on this when you check out Obama it says Osama. I guess even the spell check knows he's one of them.

These would be 8 more talking points but they are SEALED.? You cannot see them and he does not want to show you.\r\n?\r\n1. All college records;\r\n2. Selective service registration. (and he is your Commander and Chief);\r\n3. Illinois state senate record AND schedule;\r\n4. Certified copy of birth certificate AND signed embossed paper birth certificate;\r\n5. The reason He and Michelle returned their permit to practice law in Illinois and cannot practice;\r\n6. Law school test scores;\r\n7. Passports;\r\n8. College funding sources (Occidental, Columbia, Harvard, ie. lots of money)\r\n?\r\nSince college records were in the first post it does not really count again so just substitute his adoption records.

This is just a recent example of how far the Obama people need to reach for a point to counter Gov. Romney. I would have given it more attention sooner if the quote had been about Bill Clinton, but then it would have been binders full of interns.

I was at a Dollar store years ago when my two girls were little. They did not have automatic doors so I was trying to hold the door open and push a full buggie through it when my younger daughter ran in front it. She was heading into the street while I was screaming for her to stop and get myself through the door. There was a car speeding through the parking lot that she could not see because of a car parked on the curb. It would have been perfect timing. As I was screaming I knew that I was getting ready to witness my child getting run over. A homeless man was in the parking lot and started waving his arms at her and shaking his head yelling NOOO! She seen him and stopped immediatly. The car went whizzing by. I got a hold of her and started scolding her all the way to the car. After I got her in, I looked for the guy to thank him and I couldn't find him anywhere. If he wasn't an angel, he was ours.

To be honest I expect to see most of the rich leave the country if you're right, they'll only take most of the money with them. I wonder how well all of the social engineering programs will work when it's just the poor and the poor left here to fend for themselves? When they say "redistribute the wealth," I guess they mean: provide incentives for the money to leave the country.

The issue is not the degree or the person seeking the degree. The issue is simply supply and demand. In the current economic state there just isn't a demand for the degrees listed and many others not listed. I think this article is misleading in that the people seeking the listed degrees are passionate about their work and not necessarily concerned?about earning an impressive salary. Most of my?high school friends?took the business major or communications route and are scrambling to make 40k a year. I choose a vocational route and do far better than them and enjoy what I do. I started out as an apprentice electrician, became very good at what I do, made a name for myself and now work as a controls engineer for a?highly respected company.?To some of the commenter's?saying the trades are a "trap job" I say you're a fool. I'm frequently sought out by?"head hunters" for various career opportunities. I could leave my position today and be working anywhere in the world by the end of the month. For me and most everyone?working in trades the?opportunities for advancement are no different than in the corporate world. Get noticed by the right people and?opportunities for advancement follow.

Bush was given an extra term to fix his mess and see where that got us...a worser (yes I made up the word) mess. As far as I see it, Prez Obama isconstantly fighting with a bunch of people in Congress who don't even think about you. Their mission is to see Obama fail (their words exactly). The country is on the way to recovery and the Prez sure as hell cannot fix something in four years that it took eight to broke. So in Novembe....., as I would do if some Democratics were being malicious....I will vote for the guy who truly cares about me and my family because he knows what it feels like to be in need.

If you live in NYC it's certainly middle class.? Also, NYC is the type of place where you're most likely to make that income.\r\n?\r\nI worked in midtown Manhattan and made $160,000 per year.? I lived in a tiny studio apartment for $1950 a month.? Nearly half my income went to taxes.? I also had a $2000 a month student loan payment (to get that job I accrued $150,000 in student loan debt).? I did not feel at all like I was living large.\r\n?\r\nOh, and btw to get that salary I was working from 8am to midnight or later 6-7 days a week.? Given the grueling hours I had no choice but to live near work.\r\n?\r\nWhen we have these debates about what's middle class and what isn't, we really need to specify what part of the country we're talking about.? $250,000 in Manhattan is much different than $250,000 in Kansas City.

Nah... other than the wars... the snowball started rolling with the repeal of the Glass-Steagal act, and the requirements that banks lend to unqualified borrowers because of the "social dream."? Both of these occurred in the 90's.? This wasn't a Republican or a Democrat problem - it was an AMERICAN problem that got way out of control.? \r\n?\r\nBut to continue the finger pointing, race-baiting, blaming, responsibility dodging, bowing to foreign leaders... no way.? Our allies don't trust us and our enemies don't fear us.? And our foreign policy is directly tied to our economy based upon the dollars that we have to spend merely to create some?false sense of security.\r\n?\r\nRomney is a leader with a proven track record of success.? Period.? He's not perfect, he's gaff-prone, and he has made mistakes.? But he cares about America more than himself and can work with others who disagree with him - he proved that by leading in a liberal state with a good deal of success.? Obama has only created hatred, envy, and dissent.? He is NOT a leader; he is a rabble rouser.? \r\n?\r\nWE NEED A CHANGE.? If Obama is re-elected, we will NOT be measurably better off in 4 years.? It would not surprise me if we did not actully have civil uprisings.? We have already seen Governors sue the Federal Government, and refuse Federal mandates.? We are in serious trouble here, and it is not about blaming the previous administration, but about creatting a new path for America.? Can Romney do it?? I don't know.? But I know for sure that Obama CANNOT.

The tax code is overwhelming to the point the IRS doesn't have the ability to interpret it.? They rely on tax lawyers and accountants who actually work for taxpayers to explain it.?

Brief history lesson, Obey--it wasn't only African Americans who were barred from voting.? It was all "colored people."\r\n?\r\nThis included Native Americans, African Americans, and Hispanic people.\r\n?\r\nSome African-Americans speak Gullah.? Yes, this is a language (though it is a creolized language).? Quite a few people in South Carolina, North Carolina, and Florida speak it (it's an island language--these people have been living a subsistence life with little interaction with English culture).\r\n?\r\nSome African Americans are also Hispanic--and they speak Spanish. Many people who were being inhibited from voting persisted in speaking their native tongue: Italian, Croatian, Chinese, Spanish, Cherokee, Pennsylvania German (it wasn't only black people being barred from voting--many people considered Portuguese people to be colored, as well as Italians) . . . you name it. One does not have to speak English to be an American citizen--one is allowed the right to express oneself in whatever language one likes.

@ Zoe, "I wonder how many ultra-religious zealots live by "The Rulebook" I'm betting none. They just pick the pieces they like".?\r\n?\r\nIndeed, most modern variations of Christianity are basically this because the original source contains things not sociably acceptable in our culture; Even though that basically means they¡¯re disobeying their own religion).

I have compassion for people who are truly poor but I've worked with people who claim to be poor single parents that get all the goodies plus eic on their tax return which makes them get between 5k and 7k back. The problem I have is when they live with a boyfriend who is making 50grand or more?a year. That's why sometimes you see them with their nails done, hair professionally colored, and wearing nice jewlery, or driving nice cars.?It's even worse when they have a blended family and both making the same as a married couple. He gets to claim the kids they had together as a single parent and she gets to claim her kids from a previous relationship and they end up both gettin eic and a big fat check each?from the irs. If they were legally married theyd be lucky to get about 1000 back. You see, some people live on the same income as others, but because some choose to shack up they get a lot more gov. assistance then those who marry and have to claim both incomes. I guess thats why they call it the marriage penalty. I've been in the workforce for over 20 years and I see this ALOT.

Perhaps it would be good to compare the incomes earned with the amount of taxes paid in.? To me it would help to see the picture of who is giving a "fair share" by? what the average percentage of income is paid as taxes(relative to earnings)? Also, how does this amount relate to other income groups?? It is too easy to say people don't pay enough, but if they already pay a huge portion of the taxes paid and we are still hundreds of billions short of what we are spending.... Lets have a revolution and take all the assets of the top 5%!? Then everybody can have a debit card with $300 bucks on it and go out and buy cigarettes and booze.

It's very simple why 250 k is the number used. Small business owners can be screwed by taxes and this number is high enough that everyone should be able to agree for higher taxes. As mentioned many times here, very few people make more than 250,000.\r\n?\r\nI find the writer to be an instigating PoS that doesnt have the courage to post under their real name though. Twelve years of tax breaks have greatly increased the wealth of the top 5% and I never saw them 'share the wealth'. So why should I be upset if they have to suddenly pay more? We aren't in this all together. There is the haves, have-nots, and have everythings. Paying 14% of your pay should be the rate of McDonald's workers, not millionaires. Just like the free loaders, the rich arent owed any special benefits for being rich. They are rich lol! What more do they truly need?\r\n?\r\nLets get the freeloaders back to work, the rich back to paying 35%, and give tax incentives to the companies that hire americans not the other way around.

Old Testament.? It had to do with being religiously unclean, as?people were not allowed to touch anyone who was openly bleeding or be considered unclean for the entire day.? To prevent accidentally touching others within their camp (remember, back then they lived in tents), women lived outside the camp in a separate tent during that week.? They all lived outdoors, so living outside on the lawn is a moot point.? Once their period stopped, they bathed and changed their clothing so that they would be ceremonially clean again, and then rejoined everyone else in the main camp.? It was a total cultural and Jewish thing.? It has nothing to do with Christianity, unless you want to live under the Law of the Old Testament.\r\n?\r\nOn a separate note, living outside isn't all that bad, if you plan ahead to take care of your physical needs.? I worked at a wilderness camp, and I lived outside for almost 5 years.? We certainly didn't take the Bible out of context and try to revive some ancient Jewish customs, though.? We simply applied Christianity to living outside in modern-day America.? Not so weird.? Plenty of homeless people do it.? It's not that hard, if you plan right.

And I've been around a LOT of "poor people" all through the 80's when I was making crap wages at TWO jobs, I had to live in lousy neighborhoods to AFFORD MY rent and trust me, NONE of these folks were driving anything at that time which would be a Escalade or better. You all need to get off this reincarnation of the "Reagan WELFARE QUEEN" lie that people on foodstamps have fancy cars, big screen TVs and all that BS.? It is simply NOT TRUE. Most welfare mothers cannot even AFFORD a car, at least the ones I lived around for years.? Cut the crappola!!!!

Fellucio-? "All the rich, greedy pigs" , "It's not too much to ask them that they give something back to that society for making it possible for them to succeed."\r\n\r\nWhat makes you say they don't give back? And why the hatred about calling them greedy?? Do the people who take the initiative, make success for themselves, and contribute most to society deserve any compensation for their hard work? Do you know how many different organizations we donate to every year? Just something for you to think about.

Also, when I was a child, growing up in Florida in a 3 bedroom, 1 bath home without AC with 4 children and 2 adults, I thought my friend who lived down the street who had a window AC unit and didn't get Xmas gifts from yard sales was "rich". "Rich" depends on your perspective. I don't have maids, I couldn't afford to retire if I wanted to (no matter what lifestyle I chose), I don't have multiple houses in multiple states, I have a pool, but I clean it myself. I do not feel sorry for myself or anyone in my position. I am happy and do not need more. But I am by no reasonable definition "rich".

These reports paint an awful picture of molestation, showing much pain and anguish to say the least. Yes, where was law enforcement to protect and serve?? I was in a scout group for awhile in my hometown in the mid 1950s and the thought of predators around was out of mind, unheard of.? I was always cautious around strange acting ?strangers, to say the least.? In jr h.s. and on sex predators were never mentioned among any adults but most of us had heard of incidents that happened to others.? In the army at 18 in early '61 I heard of perverts out there with some of the old army slang terms.

That's not right & if I was her mom I would? make sure I see something in writing that states what the punishment is if? u return a book late. Their crushing this girl especially considering she's a freshman in HS it's important for her to go to dances & participate in other activities so she'll meet more people & feel comfortable within the high school since freshman have a hard time adjusting sometimes & some are really shy. The principal & whoever made up this rule should be ashamed of themselves, they have no heart & if their going to punish kids for little things then the kids eventually will brake more serious rules knowing something so small or big u still get into trouble.

To all of you who believe that these T-Shirts aren't offesive and that the philosophy behind "Manifest Destiny" wasn't genocide and that all us Native Americans are just hypersensitive, should go take a Native American Studies class and educate yourselves a little more before you start calling us names and attacking our beliefs. My grandmothers and grandfathers gave up their lives because of the concept behind "Manifest Destiny". My great grandmother was forcefully taken from her parents at the age of 7 and sent off to boarding school where she was beaten if she spoke Dakota, even though she didn't know how to speak English. Our language, ceremonies, our culture was outlawed until the 1970's. My great great grandfather fought for this country in WW1 even though he wasn't considered an U.S. citizen. My grandfather was expelled from school at the 8th grade because he didn't learn English. My children who attend public school have to deal and learn to tolerate kids who call them?"Prairie Niggers" everyday. So for those of you who think that we are "entitled" go visit a reservation here in the Midwest or research one and come back and let me know just how entitled you think we are!!!

It is also OBAMA who has said repeatedly "he does not need a tax cut" and has SHOWN HIS TAXES BEFORE becoming President and has fully disclosed them all ever sincew while greedy Robme says "what he pays is FAIR at 14%" while the creep also had the audacity to sit in a coffee shop with unemployed people LIVING off UI checks; "Well, I'm ALSO unemployed" and he techincally HAS been since being a ONE TERM GOVERNOR in MA leaving that state LOADED with debt.? \r\nSo here is someone that not only has not WORKED in years, just keeps making millions off of his MILLIONS, refuses to disclose more then 2 years of INCOMPLETE inccome taxes since 2011, we're ALL still waiting for from the richest man ever to run for President.? This liar and greed monger has NO BUSINESS being NEAR the WH-EVER!!!!!? I sure don't get "capital gains and dividends" as he claimed middle class people all have according to MORE of his lies in the second debate. The fact is, different set of rules for people like HIM and US? Make our lives that much more impossible with his draconian policies.

I must have been in poverty my whole life, in my house we make well less than $55,000 a year and my husband and I both have two jobs. I understand the welfare and food stamp situation, unfortunately, I have had to dip into the "pot" before for food stamps while my husband and I were struggling. We definately were not buying steaks, we were buying all the food for our child with the money.?I actually felt embarassed to?swipe my card, I guess because I knew at that point We were really poor and struggling and?people around us knew it...too...?We definately don't drive a nice car...but my "little red" gets it done. oh, and my phone is not smart at all, no camera, no internet, no txt only voice. Needless to say, not all people are trying to rape the system or claim fraudulant income. Agreed, the agency that give these subsidaries need to police it alittle more.

Kjairusa, I was not "kvetching", I was explaining how $250K sounds like more than it is. As I said, I make a decent living, and I am happy to make it. I do not live in as affluent of a neighborhood as you obviously think. I did not say my children go to a $40K per year school, I said the total cost of sending 2 children is $40K - this is to a public university, and if you think you can find a school with $3K per semester costs these days, you have got to be kidding!! ?And, ummm... No, Obama did not sign into law anything that affects the cost or repayment of my student loans. What he signed into law only affects new student loans to current students (which my children do not qualify for because "I make too much money"). There are a whole lot of misconceptions being repeated on here.

I think $250,000 can be considered upper middle in a lot of regions.? For example, if you are a police officer in Washington, D.C. and work a ton of overtime and your wife is a nurse and works a lot of overtime then you are over 250,000.? Does that make you rich? I do not think so especially in a region where the housing market is high and cost of living is high.? Now, in some other parts of the country is that rich? i am sure it is. I just feel people around this income should not be taxed more than 28%.

As a young mother, my son got to close to the river where his Grandparents lived.? Our cocker spaniel pulled my son away from the edge of the embankment that goes to the water.? She was a fat spaniel and very strong. She dragged him quite a bit until someone saw him and her. My son's little hand was hitting her the whole time she pulled his britches towards the house.? As a child, different cocker spaniel, mixed in fact, but looked full blooded saved my life. I went onto a porch next door and a dog was asleep & I evidently woke him up and he was startled and he bite my leg. I was age 8 or 9 and had played with the dog numerous times. My fat, lazy spaniel was on the porch next door rushed over and started fighting with the dog and I was able to get away from him biting me.? I have a large scar on my leg still to this day, age 63 now.? So when someone says their dog won't bite you, don't believe them.? A dog is a dog, pedigree or mixed and under the right circumstances will bite you?or anyone else.

If you make 250K to?500K you'll pay more under Obama or Romney.? If you make millions or billions you'll pay almost nothing under Romney.\r\n?\r\nUnder , Mitt Romney wouldn¡¯t pay any taxes for the next ten years ¡ª or any of the years after that. Now, do I know that that¡¯s true. Yes, I¡¯m certain. Well, maybe not quite nothing. In 2010 ¡ª the only year we have seen a from him ¡ª Romney would have paid an effective tax rate of around 0.82 percent under the Ryan plan, rather than the he actually did. How would someone with more than $21 million in taxable income pay so little? Well, the vast majority of Romney¡¯s income came from capital gains, interest, and dividends. And Ryan wants to eliminate all taxes on capital gains, interest and dividends. Romney, of course, when Newt Gingrich proposed it back in January by pointing out that zeroing out taxes on savings and investment would mean zeroing out his own taxes.  Almost. Romney did earn $593,996 in author and speaking fees in 2010 that would still be taxed under the Ryan plan. Just not much. Ryan would cut the top marginal tax rate from 35 to 25 percent and get rid of the Alternative Minimum Tax ¡ª saving Romney another $292,389 or so on his 2010 tax bill. Now, Romney would still owe self-employment taxes on his author and speaking fees, but that only amounts to $29,151. Add it all up, and Romney would have paid $177,650 out of a taxable income of $21,661,344, for a cool effective rate of 0.82 percent. But what about corporate taxes? Aren¡¯t they a double tax on savings and investment, so Romney¡¯s ¡°real¡± rate is higher than his headline rate? No. As of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has pointed out, Romney has structured his investments as ¡°pass-throughs¡± that avoid corporate tax. In other words, the 0.82 percent tax rate is really a 0.82 percent tax rate. It might seem impossible to fund the government when the super-rich pay no taxes. That is accurate. Ryan would actually raise taxes on the bottom 30 percent of earners, according to the nonpartisan , but that hardly fills the revenue hole he would create. The solution? All but eliminate all government outside of Social Security and defense ¡ª a point my colleague has made in incredible chart form.  Maybe that Romney didn¡¯t pay taxes for a decade was really a time-traveler from the future. If Romney wins, it could very well be true.

DM,\r\n\r\n I am very intrigued by your post. A few weeks ago I read one and thought it was a standalone comment, but now realize you have been doing this for months. As a counselor this brings me great concern which I would like to talk with you about offline, if possible.\r\n \r\n Please let me explain, often people become upset by routes in life that don¡¯t work out. Venting and warning others is useful. This is healthy and good. Where it becomes insalubrious is when the intensity of blaming others or a corporation cultivates into obsessed anger while personal responsibility is not accepted. \r\n \r\n Furthermore, blaming an inanimate corporation shows displacement and guilt which is often associated to emotional matters. When you vent continually about hiring the wrong broker it leads me to believe something much larger is at your core. +70 posts start to solidify this premonition. Please understand my feelings are sympathetic. Just be careful that you lashing out doesn¡¯t manifest into an adjustment disorder. \r\n \r\n While it is common to need months or even years to feel normal after adjusting to life situations and events (i.e. loss of spouse, divorce, health concern) personal attributes can also stall the healing process. i.e. Poor or negative self-image becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Consider a spouse who becomes frustrated enough to leave after dealing with their partners personality weaknesses for numerous years. \r\n \r\n So, if you are turning to technology as an outlet to reclaim control please be very careful. Especially, if the problems you are dealing with in the physical world are not getting adequate attention. \r\n \r\n Feel free to let me know if you are interested in talking further. \r\n \r\n Luke

The medical care is also very good and cost a fraction of what it does here in the USA. Still, with rent of only $400 a month I¡¯m not sure why this Larry guy needs nearly $2000 a month to live in Chiang Mai unless he¡¯s spending $1000 a month on women. Also it should be pointed out that these places are becoming less and less of a deal every day as the US dollar get weaker and weaker. The first time I went to Thailand about 15 years ago I could get about 44 Baht per US dollar, but the last time I lived there I only got about 30 Baht for that same dollar. Also, for people like me who prefer to live in Phuket and be near the beach things are much more expensive than in Chiang Mai. Still if I were not such a beach lover I would definitely choose Chiang Mai as its cooler, cheaper, less humid, and has perhaps the best food in all of Thailand.

Under Romney's plan a Surgeon making $600,000 a year would pay around $177,000 on that $600,000 the same?$177,000?as Romney on over?$21,000,000. Does anyone really think that's fair? Nothing Romney proposes is about those making $250,000 or $500,000. It's about him and people like him. The argument that people are after the money from those making around 250K?is absurd,??Nothing Obama proposes would increase it a penny and only a few percent for money earned above that. Quit drinking the Kool aid.

You are a terrible person for assuming someone is weak because they're fat. Many people can't help it. I was diagnosed with severe bronchial asthma in 2005 and ever since then my doctors have been giving me steroids claiming that it's the only thing that can help me. Guess what, steroids make you fat! My doctors never fail to give me a(n) injection of steroids or a month long steroid pack of pills to take and then tell me "oh...your fat you need to lose weight!" Thank you ****! Clearly, I was unaware! Thank you for making it physically impossible to do anything but GAIN weight! This has got to stop. Just like it's wrong to use the N word It should also be equally as wrong to judge someone because they're too fat or too skinny.? People are sick and what did they do wrong? Nothing at all, other than be sick or take medicine that keeps them alive. Not every person who is fat or too thin is that way by choice, and able to change it. And you are a hypocrite for thinking so! Many people (myself included) would give an arm and a leg to be their correct healthy weight. But we can't, and there's nothing we can do about it. I only have 2 choices. 1. stay fat. or 2. stop taking my medications and die by an asthma attack. But hey at least I'll be thin and pretty right? (sarcasm)

With a weapon trained on them, it's much easy to have time to ID.. and people not going for a gun don't make sudden moves in that circumstance.? Besides, you're talking like they came through a door and I was just standing on the other end.? Do you think any reasonable person wouldn't secure a vantage point that would give them an advantage?\r\n\r\nIf they came in without noise and wanted me dead, I'd be dead anyway.\r\n\r\nYou act like I said "You sit them down, get them a drink and get their life story."? No, you ID them and calmly resolve the situation.? Hopefully without loss of anyone's life in the process.? When a gun is drawn, I really hope the homeowner doesn't want to pull the trigger.. but it it's drawn they need to be able to.

Celebrity endorsements may have a huge impact. Don't forget about the power of social media. Consider Twitter. Kim Karshashian has over 13 million followers on Twitter. Oprah Winfrey has over 14 million followers. Justin Bieber has over 17 million followers. They influence the daily decisions of millions of people on things ranging from fashion to --you guessed it-- voting! Do not underestimate the power of a celebrity endorsement.

Pit Bulls can be very loving, gentle, great pets. Or they can be very dangerous destructive killers. It all depends on the breeding, conditioning, and care they recieve. If you breed aggressive bad **** dogs to fight other pits, thats what you have. Owners and breeders make these animals crazy with the conditioning to prepare?them to fight. If you raise a good full breed pitbull from a pup in a family environment. You won't find a better dog anywhere. It all depends on what is done with these animals. People that torture and condition these dogs to fight are to blame for the bad rap they have. And should be shot in my opinion.

My pitbull was given to me as a gift when she was 6 months and is a gift that keeps on giving.? She plays with my god children under strict supervision of course.? She is pampered and has her own physician and better health care than I do. A dogs life isn't so bad from my point view.

My latest book, "I Steal Wives: A serial adulterer reveals the real reasons more and more 'happily married' women are cheating," is an explosive book that deals with precisely this issue of meltdowns among women, what really causes it, and how it more and more frequently is leading to cheating while in relationships! And the reasons for the cheating and behaviors ain't what you think! Check it out at Amazon.com and bn.com!

Jose, a legal citizen in the U S has a household income of 50,000. He pays a total of $14,000 in taxes,$350/mo for health care, with two children he spends $7200/yr on food and incedentals, That leaves him about $24,000 for housing, transportation, utilities and other household expenses.\r\n?\r\nJorge, an illegal working in the U. S. has household income of $50,000, receives payment as a contract worker, pays no federal??state or local income taxes, no SS, no unemployment insurance charges, only about $1500-1800 in sales taxes, buys no health insurance just goes to free clinics or emergerncy rooms, he owns no taxable?property so pays no property taxes although his children are in public schools and qualifies for food stamps through low declarations of wages which cant be tracked.\r\nAt the end of the year, he has approx $42,000 for household expenses vs Joses $24,000. why would he apply for citizenship. Of that $42,000, a significant amount is sent back to his country of origin.\r\nOne example among many where the middle class hard earned money is?directed to support and solicit like ethnic and social groups votes. I dont know why any legal resident or foreigner would buy into this national disgrace regardless of political party.

Same Roland! I had another account that was closed due to our cloning troll, I opened up a few accounts because would only let me post a few comments. When I am working at home, I will have my email account open and I do business through that account. I have the other account open to play over here, sometimes they are both open because i am working while I am talking to you guys. Nothing weird, It all just depends on what my day is like. Somebody we know, (lives in the bronx) takes all of this too seriously. I just dont want to be messed with. After getting my account banned, I hooked up with someone from MSN.now and that person, if the are cloning my account or harrasing me...Gone, less that ten min.You can tell me from any fakes, I am always respectful to you guys. I may be a smart azz, but I am never mean.

It is completely unfair, and quite frankly, stupid and small minded to say that pit bulls are inherently dangerous. It is an unfair stereotype. ALL DOGS ARE INHERENTLY DANGEROUS, even a Chihuahua! The problem is the owners - the care, the training they do or don't provide, and the people who stand by and watch them treat animals badly. What is really disgusting is that we see & hear about animal hoarders all the time - how they raid them, clean up the place, AND THEN BAN THEM from ever owning another pet...and then we see people like Mike Vick being allowed to own another dog? He shouldn't be allowed to own a flea, never mind a dog! Oh, but I forgot - he's a great football player! SMH

Who cares what celebrity supports whom!? I mean common, are people realy dumb enough to vote for someone just because a celebrity they like endorses him?? That's pretty shallow and I would hope that people will at least do research on a candidate and vote for the person they truly believe will lead our country best over the next 4 years.?I understand we all have our individual beliefs and most of us are?either democrats or republicans, but we should really vote for those issues that are most important to us and the future of our country and not just because of one issue we like or simply because a celebrity endorses them.

He's also a "cling-on" so I'm teetering on the edge of the bed trying to get him to stay away so I can sleep (he won't leave me alone).\r\n?\r\nThis article is really stupid.? I wonder if Obama's government threw money to fund this Phipps' study so he could become an "expert"?? Or did Bush?? Either way, stupid.

Smart parenting. Black mobs have taken over the cities in this country. Violent crime is up 20 percent just in the past year. They are raping, killing and maiming Whites all over the country.?It's big fun.? i shoot and have my gun with me at all times. Every parent should teach their children everything about guns. They should have to take gun safety classes every year in childhood, and learn how to shoot accurately. This is a violent world, and?its only going to get worse, thanks to the race baiters like Sharpton, Jackson, Jealous, NAACP that encourages Black Hate against Whites. Then you have the druggies that will do anything for the drugs they want. So wake up people. these people will kill you and your family. Be prepared, and prepare your family to deal with it.

For a wax treatment, you might want to try Collinite Pre-was and then an application of Collinite paste wax.? It's made in Utica, New York, close to where I live.? It started out as a marine wax for boats and has carried those properties over to their carcare line.? It is hands-down one of the best product lines out there, if not the best.\r\n?\r\nRead the review on it and try it yourself.? You will be hard-pressed to find it outside this area because they are realtively small but you can get it through an internet site rather than a brick and mortar store.\r\n?\r\nYou WILL be impressed.

Beth do you know what you're talking about? An AK47 is a semi automatic rifle and nothing more. Have you ever seen how much damage a SHOT GUN can do? Especially with the barrel sawed off with a simple hack saw? Besides there aren't any AK's left...Obama and Holder sent them all (untracked) to Mexico resulting in deaths of hundreds including an agent named Brian Terry.

It is perfectly fair to ask pointed, sometimes difficult questions of those who seek public office. It would be refreshing if morons, such as those on The View, would ask the same caliber questions of those on the Left as they ask those on the Right. But, sadly, as Liberals do not subscribe to balanced tactics, truth or equal respect... it ain't gonna happen when they are the ones doing the asking. \r\n\r\nBy the way, Coastie... where do you intend to spend eternity?

Ask the Lord for forgiveness for breaking one of his 10 commandments! "Thou shall not kill" because it is in conflict with that thing about "honor thou mother and thou father" DAD TAUGHT ME TO ALWAYS SHOOT THE S.O.B. Like he always said,"If they are stupid or crazy enough to break in on you, they are stupid enough or just crazy enough to kill you" The military taught us to shoot to kill, but what they cannot do, is to teach everyone how to deal with it later in life. You have to do what you have to do for protection. I pray that the child gets some guidance and support.

Hey Greg Teta -- following along with the not-very-thrilling Rolling Stones ticket news: \r\n \r\n?sold out their Nov. 25 and 29 shows at London's O2 Arena in just seven minutes,. Fans apparently snapped up the arena's least expensive seats, priced around $152, in just three minutes, while the priciest seats at around $601 were gone a few minutes later.\r\nThe high traffic caused Ticketmaster to crash before the tickets had sold out. A holding page read, "We're experiencing high demand. You will be automatically directed to the page requested as soon as it becomes available. Thank you for your patience." Resale websites are already listing tickets for as much as $20,050.

This is a happy ending for what could have been a tragedy.? And I'm in agreement with all those of you with a gun at home, that loaded and ready for your intruder.? I don't even have a problem with the guy who wrote he won't be shooting to wound.?? All that said, this has nothing to do with limiting automatic weapons .? We need to make sure that only police and military are prepared for warfare with that kind of fire power.

Kids can learn how to use guns well.? If you're raised with them, or at least learn a healthy respect for them, you can use them responsibly.? That just means keeping skills sharp and being disciplined with them.\r\n\r\nBut it's unfortunately true that many who have guns don't follow that basic lesson.? Thinking it's better to have a gun and never say what it is and hope kids never find it.? That's just irresponsible.

When people bring up gun control and the Second Amendment they need to keep in mind that it consists of two stand-alone phrases. The SCOUTUS understood this. Also consider that the Bill of Rights (first 10 Amendments to the Constitution) CANNOT be abridged. Check your dictionary, abridged means "not to be shortened." They CANNOT be overturned. They CANNOT be revoked. They CANNOT be repealed. They CANNOT be CHANGED! If the 2nd amendment CANNOT be modified in any way, that means whatever the founding fathers meant, (which has finally been clarified by the SCOTUS), MUST stand until the United States no longer exists. And the only way for that to happen is through subversion or conquest.\r\n?\r\nStumbled across this a few years ago. Maybe it can help people get some understanding as to why the above holds true. \r\nstrategypageDOTcomSL  ? ASHhtmwSLASHhtmurphS  ? LASH20080108DOTaspx\r\n?\r\nBTW - Benjamin Franklin went to France during the Revolutionary War to secure state-of-the-art weapons for both the military AND militia members. They ALL got to keep them when the war was over. The militia consists of the citizenry at large, which is evident by the Constitutions of each of the several States of the Union.

My 13 yr old has a house key, is allowed to stay home alone, and knows where the spare key to the gun locker is. She goes to the range when I go, and has been since 5. She also knows that if she gets into the cabinet without permission or an emergency, she will not have any "personas freedoms" for a while. That said, DCF has come into our house and everything is still status quo. KUDOS young lady.

Each American must make up his/her own mind who to support, but the celebrities reveal a lot about themselves due to who they would support, and we should listen. The majority supports the Democratic and Progressive causes because they are based on equality, not based on a future in servitude to the rich!\r\n?\r\nThose that seem to support Romney seem to have personal issues or feel?that America?has failed them and would wipe the slate clean and elect anybody different, without the willingness or capacity?to explaining coherently why. Lindsay Lohan is a perfect example of a fallen princess, who desires change, as if a new President will make us forget her past.\r\n?\r\nMaybe the majority is correct, after all.....

Idiot! From one who lived through the Cuban takeover I can tell you that comparing Obama to Castro is like comparing Kennedy to Hitler. The 'other' candidate, actually, is a lot like Castro. Like Castro, Romney is a demagogue in that he will say ANYTHING to sway the public. It doesn't matter if he says one thing here and something else there, for another public. The man is a a psychopathic liar. That's the only ay he can keep a straight face when he lies. He must think we are ALL stupid, but obviously, only some of us are.\r\n?\r\nAnd as for you, FACEINTHECROWD, Cubans have BUILT Miami and a lot of Florida, not to mention many other parts of the country. No other immigrant group in the United States history has been so well assimilated or been as immediately educated and productive. You are an ****. And it is obvious that Cubans there in Miami have displaced your lazy, deluded, self-deserving life. Go flush yourself down the toilet.

God and His Word, The Bible, are eternal (forever).? "Obey your parents" applies then, now, and forever.? "Do not commit adultery" also eternal.\r\n?\r\n"Adultery" is having sex with anyone but your opposite-sex spouse.? No live-in, no pre-marital sex, no sex with little children, no sex with animals, no sex with your same gender.? These rules were made by God Himself and until He changes them (which He won't) our duty is to obey or face His judgement.

SORRY ZELDA, SLIGHT MISUNDERSTANDING. YOU WERE REFERENCING THE COMPONENTS WHILE I WAS THINKING OF THE FINISHED PRODUCT. THE PROPER TERM FOR MEASURING MOST GASSES?IS GENERALLY?X CUBIC FEET @ Y LBS?PSI?WITH X & Y BEING VARIABLES. SINCE GASSES CAN BE COMPRESSED BOTH VOLUME AND PRESSURE ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT IN MEASURING THEM. FOR EXAMPLE A BICYCLE TIRE AND A CAR TIRE BOTH CONTAINING 30 LBS PSI ARE GOING TO HAVE DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF AIR IN THEM?BECAUSE THE CUBIC FEET IS DIFFERENT, AND A CAR TIRE WITH 30 LBS IN IT IS GOING TO HAVE MORE AIR IN IT THAN AN IDENTICAL TIRE WITH ONLY 20 LBS PSI EVEN THOUGH THE CUBIC FEET?IS IDENTICAL. HOPE THAT HELPS.

Excuse me? Slavery was mentioned in the Bible and that's what "religious" people used to justify slavery in America until it was abolished. Abraham slept with his slave, when the Heberu (Hebrews as the Egyptians called them) went in to wage war, they took slaves, it was also ok for them to have many wives and then have concubines on the side. And never in my life have I ever had any gay people flaunt themselves in front of me. Nobody has forced me to accept the fact that they deserve rights too. If they want to marry, great, as long as they can divorce too. It's THEIR choice, not mine. If 2 consenting adults want to do that, good for them.? And some black people didn't hide their race? What about some of those very light skinned musicians years ago and those who looked white enough to go to white schools in the days of segregation? Do you think that every african american looked like their brothers back in Africa?

Heterosexuality is the norm.? God made woman to fit man, and to procreate if they so desire.? Homosexuals cannot procreate, but they can steal another persons surrogated child so they are not discriminated to do anything that heterosexuals do except marry.? Marriage for same sex couples is an oxymoron for morons.? It doesn't exist in the Constitution as a civil liberty, nor does it exist in the Bible...under the Judeo Christian values that this country was founded on...and no you cannot talk about it without mentioning the Bible because that is the thing that defines our culture. \r\n? \r\nJust because heterosexuality is not a choice it doesn't preclude that homosexuality is, heterosexuality is our biology and our genetic code.? If homosexuality was a trait at birth then it would be genetic.? There has never been found a gene for Homosexuality.? If it were genetic it would be recessive as that it is not the normal.? Therefore it would only be possible if two people with x chromosomes for gayness reproduced, a man and a woman, and since the man having only one x chromosone for being gay, would probably not be mating with a woman, or would he?? No genetic code has been found.? Therefore, it is a result of nurture, environment and choice.? Not saying that Homosexuals have not suffered making that choice, that in and of itself does not prove the suffering means it isn't a choice.? Choices are usually hard.

AMEN!! There are way too many of those cheats out there in the system. I think they should not allow pregnant teenagers to receive welfare, nor allow people on welfare to conceive another child. If they are pregnant, they must find a job and come off their dependence of welfare. \r\n?Also, get rid of the illegals on the system. They did nto pay into it, so they should not have it.

Being that?I know?far morepeople in the majority that actually recieve welfare than I do those in?any?minority grouping, then it may?stand to reason, if only in my own mind, that a black president doesn't change this for minorities.? At least?I wasn't led to see this over the last 4 years, nor did I want to.\r\n?\r\nNow, putting my opinion to the side,it is a statistical fact that, numerically and realistically,?there are more whites on welfare than blacks,?more whites than Latinos,?more whites than aisians...? Now what becomes a solidified truth is the fact that this has been the case under white presidents as well as the current black one.?In light of that,? I am sure it will be the same regardless of who wins.?There will remain those that take?advantage of the system regardless of the availability of work.? \r\n?\r\nAlso,? there is nothing any one of any race can do to "take their country back" because it doesnt belong to any of us.

Marfique, you got it all wrong. God did not create homosexuals. God created man in his own image and likeness. He created man for woman. Again, I stand by the principles of the word of God. Everything you said is your thinking, it is not what the word of God says. The term homosexuality is a sin as defined in the Bible and it is wrong. I said it in my post and I wll repeat again, God is a loving God and he is giving homosexuals a chance to repent and turn away from sin which is homosexuality. I will not give you what your itching ears want to hear. Sin is sin and there is no excuse or sugar coating for sin.

Almost immediately, however, that classification began to be subjected to critical scrutiny in research funded by the?. That study and subsequent research consistently failed to produce any empirical or scientific basis for regarding homosexuality as a disorder or abnormality, rather than a normal and healthy sexual orientation. As results from such research accumulated, professionals in medicine, mental health, and the behavioral and social sciences reached the conclusion that it was inaccurate to classify homosexuality as a mental disorder and that the DSM classification reflected untested assumptions based on once-prevalent social norms and clinical impressions from unrepresentative samples comprising patients seeking therapy and individuals whose conduct brought them into the criminal justice system. \r\nIn recognition of the scientific evidence,?the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from the DSM in 1973, stating that "homosexuality per se implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities." After thoroughly reviewing the scientific data, the American Psychological Association adopted the same position in 1975, and urged all mental health professionals "to take the lead in removing the stigma of mental illness that has long been associated with homosexual orientations." The National Association of Social Workers has adopted a similar policy. \r\nThus, mental health professionals and researchers have long recognized that being homosexual poses no inherent obstacle to leading a happy, healthy, and productive life, and that the vast majority of gay and lesbian people function well in the full array of social institutions and interpersonal relationships.k up with data.

I agree with the Pastor that homosexuality is Biblically not right, but what I see is that this issue has become a "BIG DISTRACTION" for most people especially Christians. You see, the homosexual issue has become the "BIG SIN" in our eyes when God sees sin as sin. The devil has the Christian world so distracted by this issue that most people are not focusing on themselves and their own sins. We have gotten into the big sin - little sin syndrome. Jesus, during his ministry on earth gave us an example as to how He looks at and deals with sin and sinners.? In John 8:1-11, the story of woman caught in adultery shows us how WE are to deal with sin ¨C we focus on our own. It was Jesus who said, ¡°He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.¡±? Homosexuality is not the ¡°big¡± sin ¨C it is a sin.?? So is shacking-up, stealing, lying, not loving one other, disobedience to parents, drinking, smoking, and many other sins.? Homosexuality is not the sin that¡¯s going to bring the wrath of God on our nations ¨C it is SIN PERIOD.? Then there¡¯s the argument ¨C God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah because of homosexual sin - Well the flip side of that argument is ¨C And He destroyed a whole world (all but 8 people) with a flood because of SIN. ?And I quote, ¡°And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.? And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.? And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth.¡± Genesis 6: 5-7. ?We all have our own homosexual sins ¨C it¡¯s just not called homosexuality.? My Bible tells me that adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.¡±? Galatians 5:19-21. God gives every man and woman the power of choice.? Jesus loves all us sinners, but He hates the sins we all commit. We are living in the last days, but not because of homosexual sin ¨C it¡¯s because of all our sins.? If the God of heaven ¨C who allows homosexuals to live and breathe everyday and not strike them down for their ¡°BIG SIN,¡± as many see it and He allows us to live and breathe in our ¡°LITTLE SINS¡± ¨C keeping in mind that to God ¨C Sin is Sin ¨C As for me, I¡¯m going to focus on my shortcoming and my sins and leave the homosexuals to God. He does not need my help ¨C just for me to love all of you.

Being influenced doesn't mean being told what to think. Children hear what others including parents and other family members say about candidates and that does have an impact. The fact this poll has?accurately picked?the winner in every poll since 1960?indicates they typically are influenced by adults around them. Can you seriously claim that most of your classmates study the candidates positions? I know I paid little attention prior to getting to voting age.

I should but I admit age has stolen my memory . I agree in part to what you said and as I age I realize any thing that incites hate is BAD , but this subject sure does. Age kind of sets you free to just feel . I have fought about this and the whole abortion issue . I abhor the thought of?abortion and will not finance it or provide transportation for it , and yet I will not vote it away . Maybe it is a woman thing I do not know. One thing I do remember and I was there , God made my brother Gay , not choice . We sibs. knew that from day one. We did not know homosexuality . We had another name for it. We called him a sissie and a sissie he was but he was born that way. And he was christened in a church and raised the same and he was a twin. He was a pain sometimes and we fought with him and each other but he the same in every other way.

Let these kids have a little more of a life before you try to make their innocence an election ploy!? \r\n?\r\nIn 2008, when my daughter was 9 years old, she was asked by her teacher who she would vote for, Obama or McCain.? My daughter, strong-willed and intelligent, and a friend, were the only ones who did not prefer Obama.? The teacher tried to change their minds, but, they were adament about their choice.? After Obama's election the class had a party, complete with cake, ice cream, and punch, but, my daughter and her friend were asked to leave the class during the party because they did not want to vote for Mr. Obama!?

The issue is not weither God made homosexuals or not. Yes, it is true that the Holy Scriptures teach against homosexualality, but the church is not suppose to run the government. Should we return to the time of the witch hunts?, when the church became so strong that it sent out it's authorities to hunt down, torcher and kill anyone who was not in compliance with the church. That is why this country has a seperation of church and state clause. Just as christians have a right to believe the way they want to; as Americans, those who choce not to believe, have that right also. If christians are extended special privleges, more or different rights than non-christains, then the constitution has been violated. We end up with a mixture of church and state.

Not to mention a little debt issue we have. I don't care if your gay. So what I'm fat! Should I be recogniaed as a minority??Is it me, or?should our attention be on other importent issues?

Is he not aware that homosexuality has been around since BEFORE his sacred bible and is not going away as long as there are still human beings?being born.\r\n?Since when have politicians needed to follow the bible stories? I thought we had a separation of church and state since before 1800. These right wing-nuts are sad fools. What happens if you're not Christian, but rather Jewish or Hindu? Does that mean we need to be converted and baptized in the name of good government? Pure insanity! Besides, most of us Jews don't believe in conversion so I guess gay Jews are in BIG trouble!

I'll admit...I was confused about where he was going with it, but, it was a very good speech, noting how silly the thumpers are (and hateful) when it doesn't even involve them. What do these thumpers think...that a gay person will ask to marry them? They need to get over themselves. Cracking a science book, every now & then, wouldn't hurt, either. They could learn where "gayness" comes from. \r\nTo those that are not enlightened.....it comes from the womb. Yes, people, your heterosexuality, homosexuality, ect. is determined in the womb. It is NOT a?"lifestyle", as some of you refer to it.?Now, get over it!

Ha! You guys don't fool me. The fact that you would make those statements shows that once a woman is onto your lies, you kick her to the curb. If you didn't have anything to hide -- if you were honest and not proficient liars -- you would not have posted a comment to try to deter women from paying attention. It seems most men believe that there is absolutely nothing in the world wrong with lying -- it's as natural as breathing.

A number of? school districts have been found to allow real left political pressure and \r\npoli-guilt trips to be forced on students.? Since this rarely makes the lib-leaning media news...they're actually probably more incidents than we're aware of.? In many cases parents have gotten involved and?filed suit against?superintendents &?their districts?in opposition to the Liberal indoctrination their child was exposesd to in the classroom. \r\n? \r\nCombine that with teachers--many of whom no longer really teach, but demonstrate and \r\nstrike against the system...and yes--of course American students will fall behind and a huge percentage will fail, drop out and go on the government dole. \r\n? \r\nChicago and their recent tirade against authority is an example----VERY POOR stats in \r\ntheir education system----and most ALL are big supporters of Obama, esp. being in his \r\nhometown.?Pressusre mounts against youth....gain their minds....but don't really teach them much of anything of substance....sound familiar?? Germany--late 30's.  \r\n? \r\nPressure indeed has been mounted against children of conservative parents, who also have a right to free thinking and free speech--thanks to our democracy!

Way to go kids! They might not realize it, but they're part of a system that stands to be compromised by the right, and that is education. Funny, we acknowledge the "takes money to make money" philosophy in our businesses, but not in our government. Education?is a?solid investment in the future work force and job availability. Yes, with student loans?it creates debt initially, but the return is not only the securing and creation of higher paying jobs, but the?repayment of student loans (and interest), and the subsequent tax revenue.?I think the two sides differ in WHO they give the handouts to - the wealthy and big corporations or the lower and middle classes,?and small businesses. Who needs the assistance more? The?kids might not realize it, but they voted in favor of their own futures.

the problem with homosexuality, besids bee inmoral, Romans 1;26 , is that these groups and we got policians in washington trying to desolved merriage to give full way to the homosexual agenda, one can't teach biblical values on schools but yet cuz its illegal not allowed, but yet homosexuality its thoughtts al school teaching that a union between tow mens or two womans its okay, and that its a familly, when even nature teach us that that is wrong, never seeing a budhole having an orgasm, or babys, so what more blind a society can be, and rebelious to what God the creator have stablish, and the we ask why so many deseases, crimes and so many other things, this country was created under a biblical foundation, and we have? steared away from that, in the name of the so call frees peech, and right. the bible says clearly , the prophet Geremiah, blessed the nation whos God is Jehova, guess what this nation have kicked God out, everything, thats why we got the mess we have..its not going to get any better.

kthrall, as someone who has no issue with homosexuality, I accept and respect your views. I appreciate that although you think it is an immoral lifestyle, you can separate it from our legal rights.\r\nAs a supporter of gay rights and not a fan of religion, I also agree that Churches do not and should not have to perform rituals of marriage for homosexuals since they are private organizations. Any changes to churches must come from the churches and their followers. I can think their decision is wrong in my opinion, but that is as far as it goes.\r\nNice that we can disagree about the lifestyle, but still agree on everything else.\r\n?\r\nAs for Joe2013, since you claim to know so much about Jesus, you should know that Jesus never spoke on the subject matter of homosexuality.

Sin is a choice, who we love is a choice, and doing the right or wrong thing is a choice. If the government is going to step in and place bills on the book to give certain rights to gays then they will have to be fare and give all acts of sin a right. Do the gays not realize that the reason those others are not asking for certain rights, is because they no that they are in the wrong already.\r\nGays?should just accept who they are and the lifestyle they have chosen to live and be happy and not ?seek the rights as a male and female partner.?? The bible said plenty of same sex relationships in the old and new testament.? The New Testaments just places all the sins in the same?basket and say not to do it, the Old Testaments name them all one by one.? The message is the same sin is sin no matter who does it ,and if it is not stopped the person(s) will end up in the hell firer.\r\n?\r\nLike I was told a long time ago " We must all work out our own soul salvation with fear and trembling" and God will deal with us all.?? Let the wheat and the tare grow up togeather and at the time of harvest God will do the separating.? \r\n?\r\nAs far as our government is concern, it is to be for the people and by the people and the majority rule and clearly in this matter the government is not listing to the majority. Because we are saying no in every kind of way we can.? If they look at the history of many powerful nations immorality is what destroyed it.? Wake up America, wake up!!!!

The Early Church began the task from the beginning.?? Most of the Gospels were formed from earlier scripts--and the Gospel as per Luke was most probably Greek, since he was a Greek physician (apparently.)?? My first (Protestant) bible?was the King James Version--translation  ?  into English was at the Royal Commission of King James the second (who was, I think, Catholic.)? The various names given to the God of Abraham (and of followers of Jesus) were muddled into Jahovah, which never existed before.? But the Holy Spirit does.? I do believe in God the Father, Jesus his only-begotten Son, *and* the Holy Spirit.? I trust in their guidance and the persons who have suffered persecution and martyrdom to give me The Truth as the Word of God appears to me.? That's it.? There are tons of scholarly notes--but go to Sunday School and find out what the big Question is first.

They need to learn about voting more than ever before so they know about those who don't care about all people and make sure they put laws in place to block all those that are less fortunate. ?It all stops here and now. ?I could go on and on. ?Acts 6-8, lets you know that Obama is what truth is so please get off this site with all this foolish talk about him and kids and their love for him. ?The ones who didn't vote for him i'm sure where?????? ?I bet if Romney would have been favored all this foolishness would be posted. ?Bottom line: ?Obama is a wonderful person and if you don't see that something is wrong with you both in the head. ?Just the fact that you got on this site and said what you have let's us know that you haven't been taught right or you just decided on your own to be a fool. ?Sad, Sad. Sad. ?You both are some of the people that make things worst instead of better. ?Obama/Biden 2012

I find it strange that gays are trying to shut down Christians for exercising their rights under freedom of religion. Christians never said that God hated gays. God loves everyone, gay or straight. He just hate the sin of homosexuality. The gays argument is with God not the Christian. I find it also strang tha gays call this a civil right. They are right in saying they have the right to do what they feel is right, but don' say it is like the same as blacks fiighting for their civil rights.?They ar not being hung from trees,?they are not told?the will be punished if?they look at a white women. No fire hoses are turned on them.?They can go to any school?they want. Ther have been no gay and straight water fountains to drink from. They have never been told to ride in the back of the bus.?You are not the last hired and first fired.

The philadelphia school district bullied my daughter because she wore a romney ryan shirt. They ?force children to see their point of view. If a child has a different view they are belittled by the teachers and students. They violated my daughters first amendment and her civil rights. Teachers should teach and not indoctrinate.

@ mewayne you need to read more of the Bible to understand it. I thought that once upon a time too, like what on earth is going on here, but the reasons for that was to populate the earth. God has since then made laws and defined what sin is (because He can do that). He was disgusted with the human race so He wiped everyone out (aka the flood & Noah's ark) and He started everything new. He knew he He had to set laws for man because men are indeed sinful and driven by desire and greed.? I agree that people cannot pick and choose the parts of the Bible that they "want" to believe in but times have changed and you have to read God's words in context. The first testaments in Bible are meant for their times but God's laws are still His laws.? And you don't have to "believe" in what the Bible says but it doesn't make it any less true or real!

This?so called?"pastor" is trying to make a moral equivalence between being Black and being gay. There is nothing in common between the two groups. It is not sinful to be Black (or any other color) and there is no death penalty in Scripture for being Black. There IS a death penalty in the Mosaic Law for male homosexual behavior and there is condemnation in the New Testament for both male and female homosexual behavior. This pastor is speaking against Scripture and therefore does not have the Holy Spirit of God behind his opinions. He is, in essence, a false prophet. Lord, may he be handed over to Satan for the destruction of his flesh so that his spirit may be saved in the Day of the Lord Jesus.

A number of? school districts have been found to allow real left political pressure and \r\npoli-guilt trips to be forced on students.? Since this rarely makes the lib-leaning media news...they're actually probably more incidents than we're aware of.? In many cases parents have gotten involved and?filed suit against?superintendents &?their districts?in opposition to the Liberal indoctrination their child was exposesd to in the classroom. \r\n? \r\nCombine that with teachers--many of whom no longer really teach, but demonstrate and \r\nstrike against the system...and yes--of course American students will fall behind and a huge percentage will fail, drop out and go on the government dole. \r\n? \r\nChicago and their recent tirade against authority is an example----VERY POOR stats in \r\ntheir education system----and most ALL are big supporters of Obama, esp. being in his \r\nhometown.?Pressusre mounts against youth....gain their minds....but don't really teach them much of anything of substance....sound familiar?? Germany--late 30's.  \r\n? \r\nPressure indeed has been mounted against children of conservative parents, who also have a right to free thinking and free speech--thanks to our democracy!

There's so much crap in there...if people really lived, according to the bible, what a freakin' world this would be. The ignorance of the times back then, the ignorant men......no one knew anything. So.........to control the people, these men decided to have a form of government. Yes, sorry to enlighten you, but, yes, the bible book was written as a form of government to control the people....the feeble, the weak-minded, the ignorant people. Hey....it still works! Well, I guess some people just can't evolve.

to me, an excellent example of irony would be something along the lines of someone believing that our military as a whole is evil yet voluntarily re-up to serve in it for 10 years. \r\nI also find it rather interesting that one never seems to hear of people lining up to become Korean citizens....not saying it might not be true, but I've never heard of it. I have however heard of people actually breaking down fences to get into the USA though... \r\nSo to be fair, let¡¯s go with another country...One that is at least similar to the USA in respect to day to day life and customs, etc...... like...oh I don't know...let's say Australia...after all they gave up their right to bear arms...why don¡¯t you ask them about their crime rate statistics? Yeah, loaded question, I actually have close family friends that live in Sydney who visit back and forth with us every other year or so that will tell you point blank what a mistake it was to hand them over. Oh yes, I remember arguing with them several years back when it was first happening...and at that time, they were bragging me us about how great it was going to be...it was going to be a much safer place to live....blah blah blah......yeah, well, they have personally admitted to me since how very wrong they were and they only wish they could change it back...FAT CHANCE ON THAT.  \r\nPerhaps you need to move to a better neighborhood if a break in and being robbed by the type of people that are looking for your weapons is that much of a concern....Or maybe, just maybe, rather then have to move to another neighbor every time one gets a little to tough...maybe someone who held on to his/hers would be nice enough to dispatch the piece of scum that was breaking into their home instead of sitting by and letting them get away it . Or maybe being unarmed and being forced to sit there and watch their family get slaughtered in front of them all the time wishing they were armed. Chance of that happening? I'm willing to bet higher then the chances of someone coming into my home and finding and stealing my weapons and fulfilling your scenario. A criminal will get a weapon, legal or not....that is pretty much the definition of criminal, one who breaks the law.. And I for one would rather have it and not need it. So this now brings us full circle as we are back to the punish the all the innocent because of the few guilty that started this thread in the first place.  \r\n¡®Hillbilly retard¡¯...really? That is where you want this discussion to end? That is really a shame..but honestly, not surprising in the slightest, that is actually the kicker I was waiting for this whole time. I (and I¡¯m sure many others) knew it was coming eventually. I thank you for not disappointing everyone, but I am surprise it took 2 complete replies before it popped up......... That is pretty much the number one of those liberal ¡®go-to lines¡¯ I mentioned earlier. I must say that I am really a little disappointed though, because you didn't call me a racist... I thought that was part of the protocol. After all, it is obvious I am in favor of the right of a citizen having tools...oh sorry...'weapons¡¯..t  ? hus meaning I am not of the common liberal mind-set which seems to be to get rid of them all (although, in their defense, I know plenty of common sense people who call themselves liberals yet still believe in the right to bear arms)....and as you have pointed out, anyone who is of these beliefs is a ¡®redneck hillbilly¡¯ ...and it goes on and on down the line until I¡¯m nothing but a stupid, uneducated, racist pig....oh, I left out bible thumper. As I originally said, I wrote the post for ¡®amusement¡¯ ...and I was actually enjoying the exchange, but it obviously got under your skin as proven by the childish banter you spewed in your closing remarks. You actually started out with an impressive retort, for what it was, but you had to lower yourself with your closing remark.

Hey I get it. If the kids say Obama is great then we should all agree. After all kids have so much wisdom about it all. Have you not noticed lately? Kids know it all. And we tell them they should voice their opinion and be their own person. \r\n?\r\nHow about this? I say we go back to the old days where kids actually got an education and discipline that helps them reach their full potential when they become adults? Has anyone noticed how stuipid kids are?now days when they leave high school? If you dont know what Im talking about ask one a question about our history. THEY DONT KNOW. so how does their vote mean anything? They cant even tell you who?takes over when the president and vice president steps down for whatever reason. My generation could not leave the 6th grade without knowing all seats and current holders in congress. Ask our great graduates what the strips in our flag mean. Ask them anything about the last 3 wars we participated in.\r\n?\r\nFrankly I dont give a #*$* about the kids vote!!!!!

Sin is Sin, no matter what your opinion. Lets get to the Bible, God created MAN for WOMAN. Men have disobeyed GOD and choose to do it their way as homosexuals, ?but this is not what the Word of God says. Gods standards are higher than man standards, therefore we as Christians and believers cannot settle?for a lifestyle that is condemned as sin in the Bible. Homosexuality is a Sin, thats why ?Gays and Lesbians?need ?to repent and turn away from sin. I do not hate the person who is gay but I hate the SIN - HOMOSEXUALITY.

I hear we're going to swap out our soldiers in the Middle East with Republicans wearing the same armor Dubya made our first wave use. Also... Chinese weapons and bullets. It's only fitting, but won't be because the same sweatshops that make that Wal-Mart junk made that stuff.

Hey, Kimberly the Simpleton...\r\nRemember that talking point you were given about Obama being a CUMMUNITY ORGANIZER?\r\nNow would be a good time to think about it... It might help you understand how utterly brainwashed and ignorant you are. Then you can start the slow climb out of the pits of ignorance that you're in..\r\nSame thing goes for the crap you say about Joe Biden... Even His wife, Dr. Jill Biden, volunteers to teach at a community college.\r\nMaybe you should learn a little about the world before you speak, ok you stupid twit?

If Romney had done this instead of that idiot Biden,?the left wing ninnies @ MSN would have said: \r\n? \r\n'Romney, in what he considers casual attire, shows he is?a cheapskate?by bringing some of his overworked and underappreciated volunteers some cold coffee and moldy donuts....proving once again how out of touch he is". \r\n? \r\nTheir question to readers would be: "Don't you think Romney should apologize to his volunteers?" \r\n? \r\nWhat a bunch of liberal a$$es. \r\n? \r\n"

It's all about control, who's beliefs and values are going to set the president for everyone else. Does anybody realize, that an overwhelming number of people don't put much credence?in the bible.

A lot of people hold being secular in high regard on social and a host of other issues, without biblical / scripture ?consideration, that's called moving forward in the 21st century.

If Romney wins, it just means you'll get more welfare checks called "tax cuts" that your kids will have to pay for. If you want more money, why don't you work for it instead of getting tax cuts from Uncle Sam? It's called the "work ethic" and conservatives preach it to the handicapped but don't practice it themselves. I had a stroke in college over 30 years ago, then went back?& got a masters in math. Then the private sector wouldn't hire a cripple, so I worked 22 years as a computer programmer for the Air Force. The person you treated like garbage helped keep you free; but I never touched your blood money tax cuts, I've seen too many friends die for your greed.

Think about the last few Presidents..\r\nWhat did they do after they left office?\r\nAside from Bush Sr., who was convinced by Bill Clinton to occasionally work for his foundation, and Bush Jr. occasionally shows up to help at Barack Obama's behest-in between puppy portraits...What was they're contribution to society in their post presidency?\r\nWe all know that both Clinton ( The William J. Clinton Foundation)?and Carter (Habitat for Humanity)?worked tirelessly to better the lives of others...You don't really hear about them relaxing on the ranch, having?tea socials or shyt like that...?\r\nThat should tell you the difference between democrats and republicans, right there.

Idiots...what are you dumb, blind, can't see?\r\n?\r\nThe claim to fame for most blacks are sports or rapping.\r\n?\r\nYou people see what alienation does to a people as fact, the proof in the pudding lies in Detroit (and other high black populated areas), yet you sit in your comfy couches and play blind, read articles like this, judge, self-hate for your own ineffectiveness and then hate others, for our ineffective local or national goverments. Blame Obama, ok! That sounds good? In Obama's defense, he could blame the last Republican President. Blame Bush. If a black man doesn't win the next presidentail election we will no doubt blame Romney. Democracy means the people govern with the right to vote, or by other means(shhhhhh). So, blame the people. I blame the people...personally I blame everyone...white and black or other...\r\n?\r\nFor being idiots...\r\n?\r\nStuck on Race...\r\n?\r\nPrimitive Monkeys...\r\n?\r\nAnd Bigots...

I will tell you a true story involving a 1 day inpatient operation I had on my nose. Mostly straighting my septum. I was in the 1 day area for about 5 hr. I was put under and my nose was rotoruttered. I came to in recovery, was taken back to my room until I got my witts back and all was stable. My wife took me home. \r\nThe bill came and 50,000.00 was billed to my insurance. I only recieved a printed overall amount and what I owed. I owed 250.00. I have no complaints about that. But I went to the hospital for a total print out to see what on earth cost 50K about this. I got my print out and after I pushed with a few questions I was told my insurance would only pay 10k and that is what the hospital agreed to charge the insurance co. The rest they write off. It's all a tax deduction scam to work in a margin on their tax return.  \r\nThis way they can say to their employees we can not give you a raise we are not making money. Then at tax time the show a big loss and get a return based on this for their profit.? A SCAM!

I am really amazed and dismayed that the fact that Romney has diametrically changed stances between the primaries and the main election is disregarded by those who think he is the better candidate now. I really do not know what his stance on many of the issues are because he has shifted to a completely opposite stance. If he indeed is doing this now to get the moderates to vote for him it is cynical game playing. How can you trust this person? The Republican party will hold his feet to the fire if he takes these liberal stances if he becomes the President. That is where his true allegiance lies, regardless of what he himself believes and regardless of what he says now. This person does not deserve to be the President. He is doing exactly what a businessman would do - he is selling something, not for the benefit of the common folks, but for his own. That is the most unscrupulous behavior a person can demonstrate.

@Walrus12 So you think no one should have the right to tell women what to do with their bodies. If that's so then no one should have the right to decided if the baby can should live or not. The baby has a body too, and if it were old enough wouldn't want somebody saying they shouldn't live. So selfish!

The best I can say to you is this, whatever your thoughts and opinions, we all have them, and I in no way asked to be attacked by providing my own thoughts and opinions on the subject.? I love *all* people, and I have no problem with people making their own choices in this life; that is not mine to choose.? But when all of us do pass away, my own personal opinion is that I would rather choose to follow the Word of God and take that chance that He may be a "myth" than be on the other side of eternity without Him.? This is not the debate, Adamus.? There is no "debate," in fact; *this* was **my own opinion**, and I did not seek nor need anyone's approval.

December 21, 2012 is just the end of a long cycle, then a new long cycle begins. With every ending comes a new beginning. \r\n The "end time" is the 12th age of a 12 age cycle, we are currently living in the "end time". Soon a new 12 age cycle will begin. The 1st age of the next 12 age cycle is called the "first time", a "new beginning". \r\n Some schools of thought consider the age of Aquarius as the 1st age of the 12 age cycle, some consider the age of Leo as the 1st age of the 12 age cycle. The 7th age is the "age of reason"! We are at the dawn of either the "glorious first time" or the "age of reason"! \r\n On earth, as it is in heaven. AMEN!

Not in the least. I'm already registered, and beside that, I have a serious personal hangup about about patronizing strip clubs, or soliciting prostitutes, or anything in that general category. All I can think about is how that's somebody's daughter or sister or something and I just don't want any part of it. I know, I'm no fun.

Whether you believe it is a myth or not, the One Who created the universe still exists.? Belief or disbelief in the Creator does not change it.? \r\n\r\nThen I saw all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun. However much man may toil in seeking, he will not find it out. Even though a wise man claims to know, he cannot find it out. - King Solomon, in Ecclesiastes\r\n\r\nYou live your life the way you want; that is fine.? These--yours included--are our opinions, and if you cannot stand to be on the same web page as others who can speak civilly and express opinions without hurling stones and unkind words, then don't participate.? I respect ideas and opinions, until they become words that go past opinions and begin to belittle others.

#Rhet15, Funny you should mention Coleman Yooung. He would have never gotten elected if it wasn't for the fact that the Detroit Police had a bad but proven habit of kicking Blacks?butts on a daily basis and?running back to their suburbs each night to brag about their exploits. I don't make any excuse of anyone Black or White who don't take care of their belongins or take pride in thier surroundings. But I do take exception with all this anti-black hate that is pouring out on these pages! If you think that all Black people are lazy and on welfare, you're seriously mistaken. Most welfare recepients are white, but that's not well publicized. It's easier to blame those you HATE. Detroit is hurting for many reasons and the major one is not the color of the inhabitants. You see the real issue is funds, not the funds you give to folks, but the funds that grow businesses. If there are no jobs on industry, then the city will die and it is doing now. The businesses are all owned by the minority majority. If you don't like the way things are going, just starve the city and wait, it will soon die and you can then retrun to take over. I will agree that there is a mentality in Detroit that is deeply rooted in the 70s and it needs to change. We as Blacks now determine our own destiney and some of us are doing a piss poor job. Some of the readers here are right in saying we need to take responsibility for our own shortcomings, and we have not! But simply being Black is not the cause, but a easy target for those who need it to further their cause.

@ Q-Z-Sue: A human being is a human being whether or not he/she has taken their first breath. By aborting you are robbing the child's future..of LIFE. How can you say a baby is just an embryo..haven't you seen pictures of late abortions?? Those pictures are very clear that the baby is not just a cluster of cells but a tiny developed human being that should have the chance to live..and make their own decisions in life. Like for example the decision to live. Once a woman is pregnant their is a another human life within her whether you believe so or not. Also it shouldn't be just up to the woman to make a decision on her abortion. It takes two to procreate and the father should have some say. In the end its not just her baby its his too. A baby receives half DNA from both parents so you can't just say the baby is the woman's only and she should have all of the say.

kimberly a ....i will say thanks ..........i,m a person who still helps the poor and soup kitchens and if obama doesn,t care that is not the subject the sucbect is the kitchen is losing money and help because paul ryan is a moran cleaning clean dishes. i,m sure if you volunteered maybe you would see life anotherway wouldn,t you. its sad bush left this mess with 2 wars ortd medicare prescription on a credit card and all and mr. obama came in and mitch mcconnel says the only thing is to not pass or help us americans do antything for the last couple years . yes a mission to stall that is worse too because once again paul ryan had his dirty hands in that too. now he wants my vote well tell him to clean his hands at work before he cleans dishes that are already clean. i,m a independent and agree that if i want a republican which i have voted for in past then i would as i would for a democrat. this election i,m thinking wow i,m done thinking my mom is on oxygen 24 hrs a day. so if you want to kill my mom then vote fro romney if you want to save my mom then vote for obama. its easy just press button with his name on it and save millions of elders. that is my belief our elders are the ones who got us here and for goverment to get cadillac healthcare after 1 term is crazy dump that and if you have kids pay for them yourself for schooling as i worked all my life . well thank you so much i bet you are a wonderful person and hope god will bless you as i do but that is up to you to do as the lord says and that is help people not kill them . everyone vote for obama he is a true american who wants to give all people a go at life ..alll i say women , men and even mr outsource mitt romney and ryan. thank you

The 2012 date on the Mayan calendar was simply where they ran out of room to carve. Scientists have recently discovered more slabs of calendars in the making that we're never finished due to the invasion of the spaniards. It's estimated that the upcoming slabs would have taken the calendar to 13 trillion more years. Hopefully dec 22 of this year will bring an end to crappy shows on the history channel.

This wanna be preacher better stop his evil ways, and stop telling lies and stop trying to get people to go against what God and Jesus Christ both said about the immoral, evil, and destructive sin of homosexuality.? If not this preacher, who is doing the work of the devil, will end up in a special place in hell that God created for all those people who lie about him, and try to get people to engage in evil and sinful behavior.........\r\n\r\nWhat is the homosexual's hope?? The only hope for the homosexual, and all people who break God's laws, is to realize that God is holy and he will rightfully judge all who have sined against him by breaking his law (1 Kings 8:32; Ps. 9:8; 1 John 3:4).? If he did not do this, then he would be approving of wrong doing.? However, God is loving (1 John 4:8) patient (Rom. 2:4), wanting people to repent (Acts 17:30) and come a saving knowledge of him so they might be redeemed.? What this means is that the sinner must turn to Christ, who is God the Son in flesh (John 1:1,14; Col. 2:9), who bore our sins in his body on the cross (1 Pet. 2:24), died and rose from the dead (1 Cor. 15:1-4), and made it possible for sinners to be saved from the righteous judgment of God by faith in what Jesus did on our behalf (2 Cor. 5:21) and be forgiven of their sins (Eph. 2:8).? This is done receiving Christ (John 1:12), by believing in him and his sacrifice that is a payment for our sins to God the Father.? Like any sinner, the homosexual needs to repent, receive Christ by faith, and be saved from God's righteous judgment by trusting in Christ and the judgment that fell upon him on the cross.? They need to pray and ask the Lord Jesus to save them.

Loaded question.? It can't recover.??The soul which kept it alive and thriving was the gigantic U.S. auto industry and all of the countless associated sub industries and suppliers.? Investment poured into Detroit and as a result produced great wealth and growth in population as seekers of employment from poorer states found a?hot market for labor.? All of Detroit's eggs were in one huge basket, cars, and it \r\nnever considered foreign competition as a serious problem and it wasn't a problem back then.?However, other countries such as Germany and Japan were beginning to develop industry and it was only a matter of time when Detroit's monopoly in the auto industry was to be seriously challenged. In the end, it was a matter of other countries' coming of age and developing their own industries which spelled doom for the big three (four if you count AMC).? Purchasers of new automobiles?saw wider choices?open to them and they voted with their checkbooks.? The rest is history.

It hurts me to see others so mistreated, regardless what it is.? NO ONE deserves this kind of mistreatment.? Ever!? My heart is out to you for all you went through.? Please accept my own apology for all who can't see past their own judgmentalism.?

Detroit is not a Democrat or a Republican issue but is a jobless issue. Wonder why there was "white flight" from the city? Do you think it had something to do with blacks being fed up with being push aside everyday and they had enough? I don't blame whites for all of Detroits ills because tearing up your things is no excuse, but I will hold both whites and blacks responsible for holding on to old perceptions that needed to be buried. But as long as both sides keep holding onto those old perceptions, then nothing will change. Whites will always think that Blacks are just lazy and Blacks will always think that Whites owe them something. For those of you who harbor those feelings, you both are DEAD wrong.

It's been a productive day: laid sod, took care of perennials and put the gardens to sleep. It was a great day to do it all. Would like one more to plant bulbs, but I'll manage in between snows. Thanks for such a complete weather forecast( (even though Sunday evening hasn't seen any rain yet) Love fall!.

You seem very lost and confused, maybe because you aren't? a Christian like you claim, God commands all Christians to lead their brothers and sisters away from sin, not lead them into sin like all the Gay Pedophiles constantly do all the time.\r\n\r\nIt's not rocket science if you support murder, rape, incest, pedophilia, robbery, homosexuality and all the other sins, then you are supporting sin doing the devil's work as only the devil and his minions promote sin!? As everybody knows God and his followers are against sin.? FYI Christians don't decide what is and isn't sin, God does and God clearly states that homosexuality is an immoral, evil, and especially destructive sin, and if you continue to sin, without repenting and changing your evil ways, you will burn in Hell for eternity, and this is the word of Jesus Christ and Our God!? If you doubt me look it up in The Holy Bible.

Iron sits in the blood, as if in a pocket.? If you are lacking iron, you may need to take supplements.? If you received a transfusion, what was it?? Was it full blood?? Was your hemoglobin low?? Levels should be approximately 12.? What is your ethnic background?? There is a condition wherein some people from Africa, southern mediterranean, and Asia are lacking an enzyme in the blood which causes hemolytic anemia (low blood count). It's called G6PD deficiency (glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency).? It requires transfusions.? It is an x chromosome mutation; therefore, when you obtained an x from your mother and an x from your father, even if one were bad, you can suffer from this.? There is no cure, but you would need to eliminate certain medications, alcohol and food so that your blood levels would be correct.? Have that checked.

Of course Obama would win, look who is taking the votes.

Teachers today forget that they are to educate and not endoctrinate.

The problem is the people, no self respect, laziness, no morals and the nerve to think they are suppose to be given things for free.

Macro-evolution is not a theory. Macro-evolution is not even an educated guess. In fact, it is hardly even an uneducated guess. It makes no attempt to model real-world observations, data, or information; while pure materialist try to distort data to fit a prior conclusion to make their world view ?more credible. Rather, macro-evolution is a magical story to fill in the gaps of our knowledge when we were not equipped with the ability to understand. Therefore, it is in no way a viable or possible explanation since it doesn't model any data in the first place. Sure, macro-evolution can be taught in World History or some such class, but certainly not in a class that preaches it to be a viable explanation or supported conclusion. Creationism, rather, is supported by a compendium of human knowledge, experiments, gathered data, and observations. Nothing negates this theory. And, the support for Creationism is so overwhelming and conclusive that it is defined as a Scientific Theory, the highest level any body of knowledge can be promoted to. I hope that clarifies things for you, Omega. It is legal to teach macro-evolution in public schools as a viable conclusion, which nothing but magic.

You have to know that political correctness has completely run amok in this country when people are denied their religious beliefs and they are trying to force people to accept the immoral, evil, and destructive sin of homosexuality!? Next the political correct folks are going to try to force us to accept bestiality, incest, and pedophilia, and homosexuality as being normal, instead of the evil and destructive and immoral sins that they are.? If you are a real Christian then you listen to God, you know the difference between right and wrong, and when they are trying to force sin and immorality upon you and your family you can tell them TO STICK IT WHERE THE SUN DON'T SHINE!\r\n\r\nHAVE A NICE DAY!

Actually, prostitution across state lines, or between the US and another country, is a violation of the federal Mann Act?1U.S.C. ¡ì¡ì 2421-2424. ?Apparently the pimp was on parole, and as someone has already pointed out the conditions of parole may be less burdensome than prison, but they are based on the notion that the person on parole has received grace, but is still subject to the terms of imprisonment. ?A prisoner doesn't have all the rights of a non-convict. ?Similarly with someone on parole.

Readalot-That is a bunch of crap. Pure BS. Quit making excuses for them already.? That is All your doing is making Excuses for them. \r\nIf black people want white people to stop using the word ****. Then black people need to stop using it themselves. If not, tough. Is their intelligence level That low that they can't comprehend that, if you want everyone to stop using a word, then stop using it yourself. If they can't understand that, either one, raise your intelligence level higher than 8th grade and comprehend what you are asking everyone else to do, and do it yourself, or sit around complaining when everyone else keeps using it cause you are.? Black people have one standard for all the rest of us, high, political correct, can't make Any mistake. While having a different standard for themselves, they get to do what they want and not care.

After the divorce, I lived on my 32 ft. sailboat for a few years. A big orange stray cat that hung around the docks, decided he liked to sail and moved aboard. About the same time as the divorce I also lost my job, ?so I took what little money I had left?and started sailing up and down the west coast. Captain Morris (the cat) turned out to be a great sailor and companion. We sailed to Hawaii (where he never got off the boat) and on the return trip our first landfall was Monteray Harbor. We both had our "sea-legs", ?but walking on a dock that didn't move proved difficult until we got our "land-legs" back. A group of people partying on a boat in the harbor roared with laughter as the cat and I came staggering down the docks looking like a couple of drunk sailors.

YES! \r\n?? ?Mormons on their missions do not serve the United States of America. They serve their church.? The Romney boys should've delayed going on their missions until after serving time in the military. Ann lives in a male dominated religion where women are treated as second class citizens.?She will blindly follow her husband and bishop. By listing to her talk about things you can see what Mitt is really like.\r\n?? ?I am not a Mormon, but I know many who are. I do know that Mormons gave up bigamy a long, long time ago. The group of Mormons who still practice bigamy are called Fundamentalists.? They would probably stop it if they had to support all of their wives and children by themselves instead of getting government money and assistance.\r\n???? Personally I don't like Romney or Obama. I will vote for the unknown third presidential candidate or put myself in as a write in candidate.\r\n?\r\n??? I WANT TO THANK ALL OF OUR MILITARY MEN & WOMEN WHO HAVE SERVED OUR GREAT COUNTRY.

First, HIS country (the U.S.) declares that he and his family are possible spies so they lock them up in a detention camp.? He then volunteers to fight for the country that locked him up, while his family remains locked up and when the war was over and he was able to come home, they finally released his family without so much as a "sorry!"? \r\n\r\nThis gentleman goes far beyond the term "HERO!"?

Guarantee he'll be on this one like a fly stuck to fly-paper.

Idol didn't lose it's audience because of competition from other talent shows. They drove their audience away with poor decisions. After the loss of their original judges they have yet to come up with a credible panel of judges. They have made it clear they are more interested in boosting the careers of fading artists than in discovering and promoting new talent. They have made it clear they will never fix a voting system that can be manipulated by organized voting blocks, thus skewing the results to give us winners who are neither the most talented nor the most popular contestants. They also seem to have little interest in effectively promoting the careers of those contestants they sign to recording contracts after the show. After 12 seasons only two winners have gone on to major recording success, along with some non-winners who number is so small they can be counted on the fingers of one hand. The most recent of those, Adam Lambert was the runner up on Season 8, so that means the last four seasons have produced no major recording artists. The judging panel for the upcoming season 13 seems more like a desperate flail th****gitimate effort to make the show about finding and cultivating talent again. There was a time when I thought I'd be enjoying Idol for many years to come, but no more. I can't think of a reason to watch the train wreck it has become.

Technology is a good thing but things are getting out of hand. There's no such thing as the "personal touch" anymore. Heck, people can be standing 10 feet from each other and still find the need to text...unreal!\r\n\r\nI've text'd one time in my life...just to prove to my wife that I could do it. I prefer to call. As far as banking transactions over the phone...no thank you. It really doesn't take that much time to do it the old fashion way...

The question Joe is what does JESUS say about homosexuality? Personally. The answer? N?O T H I N G. And if being gay leads to mental disorders, maybe you are gay because you are crazy as f*ck, Joe. And also, heterosexuals can get STDs as well. Read an STD pamplet written AFTER 1986.

MYTH # 4\r\n LGBT people don't live nearly as long as heterosexuals. \r\nTHE ARGUMENT\r\n Anti-gay organizations want to promote heterosexuality as the healthier "choice." Furthermore, the purportedly shorter life spans and poorer physical and mental health of gays and lesbians are often offered as reasons why they shouldn't be allowed to adopt or foster children. \r\nTHE FACTS\r\n This falsehood can be traced directly to the discredited research of Paul Cameron and his , specifically a 1994 paper he co-wrote entitled, "The Lifespan of Homosexuals." Using obituaries collected from gay newspapers, he and his two co-authors concluded that gay men died, on average, at 43, compared to an average life expectancy at the time of around 73 for all U.S. men. On the basis of the same obituaries, Cameron also claimed that gay men are 18 times more likely to die in car accidents than heterosexuals, 22 times more likely to die of heart attacks than whites, and 11 times more likely than blacks to die of the same cause. He also concluded that lesbians are 487 times more likely to die of murder, suicide, or accidents than straight women. \r\nRemarkably, these claims have become staples of the anti-gay right and have frequently made their way into far more mainstream venues. For example, William Bennett, education secretary under President Reagan, used Cameron's statistics in a 1997 interview he gave to ABC News' "This Week." \r\nHowever, like virtually all of his "research," Cameron's methodology is egregiously flawed ¡ª most obviously because the sample he selected (the data from the obits) was not remotely statistically representative of the LGBT population as a whole. Even Nicholas Eberstadt, a demographer at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, has called Cameron's methods "just ridiculous

MYTH # 8\r\n Gay people are more prone to be mentally ill and to abuse drugs and alcohol. \r\nTHE ARGUMENT\r\n Anti-gay groups want not only to depict sexual orientation as something that can be changed but also to show that heterosexuality is the most desirable "choice" ¡ª even if religious arguments are set aside. The most frequently used secular argument made by anti-gay groups in that regard is that homosexuality is inherently unhealthy, both mentally and physically. As a result, most anti-gay rights groups reject the 1973 decision by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) to remove homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses. Some of these groups, including the particularly hard-line , claim that "homosexual activists" managed to infiltrate the APA in order to sway its decision. \r\nTHE FACTS\r\n All major professional mental health organizations are on record as stating that homosexuality is not a mental disorder. \r\nIt is true that LGBT people suffer higher rates of anxiety, depression, and depression-related illnesses and behaviors like alcohol and drug abuse than the general population. But studies done during the past 15 years have determined that it is the stress of being a member of a minority group in an often-hostile society ¡ª and not LGBT identity itself ¡ª that accounts for the higher levels of mental illness and drug use. \r\nRichard J. Wolitski, an expert on minority status and public health issues at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, put it like this in 2008: "Economic disadvantage, stigma, and discrimination ... increase stress and diminish the ability of individuals [in minority groups] to cope with stress, which in turn contribute to poor physical and mental health."

Obama did a great job last night! Telling lie after lie. 1. Oil is at it highest production right now. Guess what? So is gas at the pumps. 2. He mentioned he is aware Al Queada is on the move. Really? A few weeks ago, on record, he stated they have all but wiped out Al Queada forces. 3. He states he bailed out the big car companies. Okay, it was with OUR money and guess what the latest news is? GM just announced they are opening 5 new plants in China. So rush out and buy a GM product. And since you democrats don't mind Obama spending YOUR money. Think about this. Right after being elected he gives millions in stimulus money (our money) to 3 energy companies, that ALL went bankrupt. And he wants 4 more years. Only morons would vote for him.

IDK, If she did it she's sick and needs help badly, if they are trying to cover this up to play down the fact that the kkk exist and are active in that area to keep down any reaction from other groups the truth will come out.? It seems very far fetched to me... "I'm just saying"

Romney probably has investments or "firends" with investments in the business of War (i.e. supplies, products, arms, etc).? I am sure it's just an investment in his & thier pockets.? Don't worry about "our" kids, they are dispensible.? What other reason could there be?? How sad?

Absolutely. Its only going to be there for a few days and it celebrates one of our most famous holidays. I can understand if it was something that made a lot of noise and bothered others sleep. Even if the lights bothered others they could arrange them to be turned off my ten o'clock. Some people are so uptight that they can't let others with more free spirit enjoy this world. It would be terrible if every single neighborhood had the same dull rules and no one was allowed to have fun on halloween, or Christmas, New Year's, Valentine's Day, Easter Sunday, Kwanza, Ramadan, Thanksgiving, and any other holidays. Why don't we just build and paint all our houses the exact same color and style and nobody ever changes a thing. Man what a dull world that would be.

She needs mental help and they need mental help. When I read this story I knew it was ****. One reason shes talking if it had been the kkk god bless them. She would be dead. She was looking for money and a free ride. The klan doesn,t have to kill anyone they are doing it there self why waste a good gallon of gas or bullet. Everyone jumped on that one real quick. I bet all the black preachers had already bought tickets to louisanna. lol Had already notified the news of there impending arrival lol. goning to have to do a better job playing the race card.

I'm not saying anything about the bayonet but nowadays they are not used in combat. While i was serving in the army and overseas not only did we train to be proficient on our personal weapon and the other weapons that the Army uses,?we were also trained on the AK-47, RPK, and the Dragonoff thats commonly used by insurgents. Along with that we were issued Benchmaid and Gerber field knives along with the M9 pistol as our sidearm. but in order to have an understanding to using those weapons properly the bayonet training you do in bootcamp is essential to understanding how to use and be proficient in CQC (Close Quarters Combat)...

A lesson or two on the English language might be a good place for you to start before you challenge someone else's credentials. Romney was presidential, Obama was a smart mouthed punk. As for Coulter, she certainly is no worse than the likes of Ed Schultz or worse yet, Bill Maher. Above you wiill find the definition of a word that the politicaly correct police have deemed offensive. Study it for a moment.

There was a story a couple of years ago similar to this one where a woman doused herself with acid. Police saw the flaws in her story after she was 'miraculously wearing new sunglasses....at night'.\r\n\r\nI feel sorry for the people that do this to themselves, but to try and make it look like a hate crime? Who would the real racist be then? :/.\r\n\r\nThis kind of thing really has to stop, people will never just see eachother as equals as long as people keep trying to play the race or LGBT card. We're all just human at the end of the day!\r\n\r\n(a late add-in - I'm totally not racist and I'm bi, so not against LGBT folk either before someone tries to twist that lol ; ;.

I should read through all the comments, I just mentioned that story too then scrolled down to see yours! I couldn't find the original story anywhere either :( but like Oregontoo I remember her trying to blame it on an African American woman; ;. Worst part of it was the description of the imaginary woman she gave matched someone else who then had to put up with people's stares and harsh words. People never understand that in times like this, the greatest damage is done to others and not themselves.

I just want to add she is a total moron anyone who is willing to harm themselves are just flat out stupid and there probably isnt anything wrong with her mentally. The last time i checked ignorance, stupidity, and plain hatefulness wasn't a mental illness.

Considering there were about 11,000,000 Allied infantrymen under arms in Europe alone in 1917, and that the Coalition?has only about 300,000 infantrymen on active duty today in all theaters, and that each would only use one bayonet at?a time, I don't really think it would be necessary to have ever served as one to know the statement was accurate.

He likes to make himself look important when the truth is he is nothing but a race baiting bigot.? The amazing thing about these incidents is that when they are proven wrong or proven to be liars none of them apologize!

I would guess she didn't expect to live. Burn injuries are considered the worst - they tend to be the most painful, the most disfiguring and have some of the longest recovery. I cannot possibly imagine anyone so filled with hate that they would intentionally set themselves on fire.

I am of Dominican descent and Im a cinnamon complexion , as well as my parents. I have aunts and uncles that are light skinned and have blue and green eyes that speak spanish. Does that make them less Dominican? Does that make me Caucasian?No, theres multiple theories on what the word Hispanic means, and who were referring to. Because i am of a darker complexion, I am referred to as "black", opposed to those of lighter complexion who are considered "white". ?It is assumed that most Hispanics are light skinned in complexion because of the way it is portrayed around the world. Why not share the different types of Hispanics instead of the ones you see all the time? \r\n I understand what you mean, but thats not what its about.

Hatch back with fold down seats makes a nice little station wagon , I took my rear seat out and fabricated a nice floor , and a large rear door for ease of access .\r\n??? I am driving one today w/ 170,000 miles on it and still going strong , sorry charley (Ford) ?you screwed up as always but now as I see new cars , I may have to look elseware , AMERICA IS AWAKANING, if you make shotty shot we are smarter than your engineers and will buy good shot , wake up america

But neglect to read further where it also says you commit a sin when you wear plaids and checks together.? Christ did say "He who is without sin cast the first stone".?

Sounds like Romney has something to hide along with avoiding taxes.

The reason prices are down is due to the lower cost for winter blend gasoline which are cheaper to produce than the summer blends. You can try to prop up this administration as much as you want, the people are not stupid.Wake me up when the price approaches $ 1.89.. like way back when George Bush was our president.

According to the Urban Dictionary: \r\n? \r\nshuck and jive: \r\n? \r\n      To shuck and jive" originally referred to the intentionally misleading words and actions that African-Americans would employ in order to deceive racist Euro-Americans in power, both during the period of slavery and afterwards. The expression was documented as being in wide usage in the 1920s, but may have originated much earlier.\r\n\r\n"Shucking and jiving" was a tactic of both survival and resistance. A slave, for instance, could say eagerly, "Oh, yes, Master," and have no real intention to obey. Or an African-American man could pretend to be working hard at a task he was ordered to do, but might put up this pretense only when under observation. Both would be instances of "doin' the old shuck 'n jive."\r\n\r\nIt has been adopted into non-Afroamerican speech, with a reference to behavior adopted in order to avoid criticism.  ?  But i still think Palin came off as a racist idiot.

He was released in an area with many other squirrels around. I hope they welcomed him. He did not grow up with other squirrels. I did the best I could to socialize him. I would line the fence outside my bedroom window with peanuts to attract squirrels?and?they would see?each other?through the screen of the window. He left when he was ready. I spent many hours with him outside in my fenced in yard. He explored local trees and would come back to me when he wanted. He learned how to build a nest when he was very small.

As long as Obama is in office gas prices will remain high due to uncertainty and his lies about domestic drilling....I'm ex oilfield and when they saw Obama was elected in 2008 they were very nervous and still are for good reason....

Why is it that when anyone says anything even remotely questioning to, or about Obama they are met with a hateful force, the likes of which I have never seen before?? Don't you liberal folks have any sense of human decency in you anywhere?? Personally, I believe Obama is a muslim and was never legal to be president in the first place...? Further, he has proven himself, on every occasion he's been offered, to be a socialist dictator who doesn't really have any kindness for the American people whats so freaking?ever.? The constitution sais WE the people...? Obama sais ME the people.? Romney has been nothing but a gentleman to Obama, even in the face of all Obamas hate.? I don't want to?see anyone even remotely hateful running anything in our government!? As for the Donald, he is just another human being with the same rights you and I enjoy, so lay off.

"By the way, amaya2112, you are so full of feminazi venom and misandrist hate that you will never be taken seriously by anyone except yourself."\r\n\r\nI'M a femnazi and misandrist just because I commented on what I've seen with my own eyes?? I've seen hateful comments about women on this site, Youtube, and pretty much everywhere I've been where people can make comments and have commented about this subject.? You have a lot of nerve to call me a misandrist and make it sound like women are evil despite the fact that some men are guilty of the same thing.? Of course, it's TOTALLY FINE when men do it, which is yet another inequality that everyone is ignorant to.

This is a forum to express our views on here and those of you that think you know what the government controls and does not you are badly mistaken. I actually work for the government and everything can be control even in the Great USA. Those of you that can not stand any negative views of Obama should open your eyes, he is not perfect. But his Romney is worse, so I choose Obama also. But he has made a huge mess here himself so why are so many comments about Bush on here? This campaign has been nothing but a smear one on both sides.

Let the dead rest in peace. There are many talented people in the world. MJ was who he was. He, like all humans was not perfect. Neither was Elvis. You can spew out all the hatred OF the hatred you want to, but Micheal Jackson was the greatest entertainer in the industry. He had the respect of people like Fred Astair and Liz Taylor. Leave him alone, and Elvis too. Elvis made a big dent in the industry, but making a comparison is so stupid. MIcheal was the first Artist to create video stories to match his songs. Everyone else is a copy cat. There is no singer dancer like MJ. Some of you are jealous, the truth is, what it is. Get over it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ? !!

Forget about BING. Let's stick to the subject and title this BIGGEST IDIOTS. After all that is going on in the world, people that can be fed, homes that can be built, jobs that can be given, these selfish dorks spend on things that have no matter. Solid gold leggings? Seriously? $23,000 freakin dollars for damn heair extensions? There are hair dressers who have worked so hard to get to a level of expertise that would charge, probably $1,000 a week. It's crazy that when you have you seem to care less about the world around you. It's those with the least that seem more humble and care more about others and the environment. People with the money to throw away like these, only give to charities and organizations? because they have to. Tax purposes, etc. I'm not saying that there are not celebraties with HUGE hearts who are conscience of our world and their fellow brothers and sisters, but it sickens me to see such idiots throw money away out of being so spoiled. Madonna, PLEASE, that dang water ain't doing a thing for you, girl. Spiritual my ****. You're as much of a stuck up Diva as you've always been. Beyonce, you ain't too far behind, woman. And J-lo, yeah, I don't even need to say a thing with your $5,000 eyebrow specialist and fox fur eyelashes. Good Lord. Remember where you came from and how you were able to manage without so much. Money does make life easier, but we must still remember where we came from and how at any time, it can all be gone.

You could say shuck and jive schtick about anyone, including black people.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning behind claiming it's racist is the usual nonsense...jive is a word associated with black slang, like 50 years ago, so using it as part of a phrase describing a half-black person is racist because...black people used to use the word.??

On?MSNBC, she said, ¡°What I would say is that the news media should do a penetrating expose and take a look. I wish they would. I wish the American media would take a great look at the views of the people in Congress and find out, are they pro-America or anti-America? I think the American people would love to see an expose like that.¡± \r\n She did know at the time that the GOP since 2008 is the most Anti-American group of Congressman in the History of the Untied States of America.....

Walrus, hon, look up books by Dr. Michael Baden, M E. ?In one he states often family members are so saddened at the possibility of identifying a loved one they don't really get a good look at the deceased. ?Some barely open their eyes. ?Interesting story with happy ending.

@RT I agree, kids should be able to defend them selfs against bullies. If my kid was getting bullied I'd let my child stomp the kid than I'd have my son transfer schools. Than I'd rip the kid myself and have a word with the parents as well. This world can go without teens bullying other teens simply because of the way they dress or rumors spread by ignorant teenagers. The only way to stop a bully is to show them your no longer going to be picked on.

Well, we don't have a shortage of teachers like that in the states either....Too many people are looking at teaching jobs as just that, a job! While there are some quality teachers out there we definitely have those teaching who don't have any patience with children what so ever....I have two teens and live in a fairly wealthy area and trust me, we have those that don't care. However there are those that do a excellent job and communicate with the parents every time the student begins to show signs of problems and are genuinely concerned. Some teachers have this entitlement attitude going on and even take attitude with the principal and the parent and it just irritates me to hell and back. Those teachers who think that teaching is just a job....need to find a new one! \r\n? \r\nI would love to have the authority to clean house, and really who better then a parent who stays involved with their children. I do feel sorry for the teachers who are out there day in and day out doing an excellent job because the ones that aren't are giving schools a bad name.

well i did a little research - some of us actually try to answer questions. the editor is Vern Anderson. while i could not find out his religion, i found an obituary for a Vern Anderson, who has a son named Vern Anderson, all from Salt Lake City, and the elder Anderson was LDS. normally, family does not abandon a religion. so, unless there are a LOT of Vern Andersons in SLC, the chances are pretty good that this editor is LDS. yes, the title of the article is a bit misleading, since the editor, regardless of his religion, does not represent the church, but it's close enough for internet "journalism."

The teenage years are very hard emotionally and hormonally, and if there are also mental issues, the result can be terrible..... If you look at depression-suicide statistics, women are twice as likely to get depression as men, but men are 7 times more likely to commit suicide. That's a 14-1 difference!... Mental health professionals try to explain the differences with testosterone and hormones (men are much more willing to commit a voilent act).... Yet according to the media it's only "the poor cute teen girls who are terribly bullied" who end up?killing themselves.

I'm not sure about Palin being a racist, but she is ignorant and publicity seeking. The comment? has racial overtones. I may not agree with all of the president's ideas, but I think he is very intelligent. I have not agreed with all of the ideas or decisions of any president. The public is much harder on Obama because he is the first African American president. He has done no worse than any other president in office. President Obama really appears to care about this country and he reminds me of Clinton. But then again each of us have said the wrong thing at one time or another.

Decider...In my day it was accepted by the teachers to let the kids work it out. One time I broke a kid's nose in the 9th grade for messing up my hair. Right after I hit him I looked up at the Gym teacher and he pretended like he didn't see a thing. I fought all the time in those tough schools and never got punished for it. My son defended himself in the 4th grade and was going to be put in detention. I talked the principle out of it. It's all about law suits. It has to stop.

Victoria: This actually takes money from the middle class and the poor and allows the rich to keep their money in the bank while the taxpayers pick up their nursing home tab. As of now, Medicaid will pick up the tab based on financial need. If Medicare picks it up everyone gets it, including the millionaires at taxpayers cost and we all run out of money for Medicare. Everyone will and does get care, no one is rejected. It is just a matter if the patient pays for it or the taxpayers do. This story is very misleading. It makes it sound like elderly are not able to go to nursing homes, but there are plenty of poor people in nursing homes.

Republicants:? If you can't blame Obama for Upchucks salary going down, or his healthcare costs going up, both of which are reality for him, then logically, ?you can't give Obama credit for your healthcare costs staying the same and your salary going up, unless you belong to a union company that might have some special favor with Obama, which of course would be a skewed view to begin with. \r\n? \r\nHome values are still spotty, and the report just today showed a very weak number for new housing starts.? Unemployment is going down, but only if you believe that creating 114,000 jobs drops the unemployment rate nationally by 3 tenths of a percent in one month.??But, of course, it's much easier to get it down when thousands continue to drop out and the participation rate is in the toilet.? Not to mention that Obama has begged certain companies to hold off notifying their employees of coming layoffs until after the election. \r\n? \r\nSo, you can't get by with telling just half the story on what you percieve to be good news.? If you only look at the positive side and don't question the whys behind the numbers, then it's easy to believe things are getting better.? On they other hand, reality, and I mean the real situation Upchuck faces everyday, tells him otherwise. \r\n? \r\nAll I'm saying is just look at both sides and then make an objective opinion about the situation.

That the tirade was directed at a vet who fought to protect us and lost his legs in the process makes this story even more disturbing. Everyone in that restaurant should have stood up and handled this jerk. And to the vet, I am sorry you were treated this way. Thank you for serving our country. I for one appreciate your service to our country and am so sorry you suffered such a loss and suffered the ravings of an ungrateful bully,and a jerk.

i have been following a lot of former GOP leaders, especially some of Reagan's advisers, even though I am a liberal democrat, because i started to see in the media this backlash of true conservatives against the fundamentalist turn with the tea party. i ?honestly feel bad, because having your political party hijacked by a bunch of loonies doesn't help the US. when arlen specter died (i'm from PA and live back here now), i was reminded of what a moderate republican looks like. he lost his seat because of the tea party, after serving this nation for 30 years. the tea party's mantra of "throw the bums out" shows that they don't even try to figure out who is doing good and who isn't, they will just vote out anyone, and put any RWNJ in their place. i think we are heading towards a time, in this next election cycle, when we can have a 3rd and even 4th party come to prominence - the fiscal-conservative,  ?  non fundy Republicans, and the far-left Democrats are not represented in today's US (despite what most of these tea party people think, obama is NOT anywhere near liberal). if i was a republican, i would lay on my leadership to get back to being americans and not fundy terrorists.

Unfortunately large banks don't really care about the customer. I don't mean those on the front lines like tellers, or those working the submittal of loans but the people you don't see like the Bank Manager, the loan processor. I am now approaching 8 months since applying for a re-fi with US Bank. Still not funded. There excuse, we are understaffed, and had not done these types of loans before (heart loan for a property underwater) . Strangely enough they came after me. Why do you solicit business if you don't know how to do it?

"Shuck and jive" has moved from wherever it may have originated, having something to do with African-Americans, into general parlance, just like "shtick."? (Nobody thinks Palin's suggesting Obama's a secret Jew.) \r\n? \r\nWithout winning supermajorities of black votes, Democrats are toast, forever.? Therefore they spend inordinate amount of time trying to convince minorities that white people hate them.? Which goes a long way (more so than actual racism, which has been beaten back to a few inbreds with little to no influence on society)?towards explaining the alienation and resentment in disadvantaged minority communities, which discourages many of their young men from participating in mainstream civic and economic life, leading so many of them to murder each other.? Whether you like it or not, you race-baiting Democratic sociopaths, you have minority blood on your hands.

I am a member of the holy religous order of the filet mignon.? We do not believe in doctors, We believe when you are sick to pray for healing.? If your an athiest, then drink a six pack. but you will have to notify the govt of your exclusion.? \r\n?\r\nAnd guess what!? Obama care is already being used.? If you go to the doctari, used to be he would make out a prescription and off you go.? \r\nNow the doctor has to list all the ailments so the insurance will pay on the prescription.? Thats obamathreat in action.? \r\nNow if i go to your doctari and ask what is wrong with you, i will be told, cant tell you privacy act, however now, EVERYTHING THAT IS WRONG WITH YOU will be sent to some idiot who will verify that the drug you were prescribed is for the ailment you have.? This is already happening.? It aint gonna happen in 2014.? So thanks to Ovomit, my privacy is being invaded, as my ailments are being broadcast to people who have no right to know whats wrong with me.? \r\nAnd the libs keep saying the cons keep infringing on our rights. \r\nNot to mention, what if you doctor does not use the 'MAGIC WORD' or even better the person is having a bad hair day and the prescriptions you have been given are not filled??\r\n?\r\nWhy do the canadians come here for health care? Because they already got ovomitcare and we actually have some pretty good doctors and hospitals here in comparison to other places.\r\nGovernment run health care is what the military has.? Been in the dysfuntional family.? Got sick?and had a chest?cold.? Went to see the doctari.? He asked me what was wrong. I told him.? He then asked me,what do they usually give you for this.? So? i told him. he wrote the scripts.? I asked him why he?did not know what?meds to give me.? He answered, in the condition your in i have no idea what to do with you.? I asked him why.? He said he was a coroner and they had to pull er duty.? Thats?govt run health care. \r\nCourse the only businesses the govt currently?runs are the army, which we are borrowing money to keep it going and the post office which is bankrupt.? and we want to add health care to this mess.??Ovomit cant even balance the budget.

The idea of intraterrestrials was brilliant.? Twin Peaks underworld realm evokes a eerie feeling of childhood magical thinking that fits in well with fairy tale realms, shamanic aboriginal "dream time" and the feeling that?this "consensus reality" is only one of many (and it's always only held together tentatively).?I feel that there is much more that?might have been done in the series to develop these themes. \r\n?\r\nIf as some modern physicists now suspect matter and energy turn out to be only special forms of information then?our modern worldview's absolute faith in "materialism"?may soon be proven wrong. Some may be ready to explore the greater possibilities but most of us will feel safer imagining that the our old worldview of the separation of?mater, energy and information is still intact. It's nice to?imagine that some things are only make believe.

If that's the case, then you need learn to either roll with the punches and become more competitive or shut your hole and find another line of work.

He was a prominent member of the democrats and was also a card carrying member of the KKK when he was younger.? The liberal?media said all kinds of wonderful things about him but they failed to mention that BIG fact.? He passed away this year and let's not forget that the republicans freed the slaves.? They also had a big hand in the passage of the civil rights act of the 60's, which the democrats of the south wouldn't pass.

They should be thanking GOD that they do not have it like us. That people will not get tired of the word homophobe when some one says a bad thing against them....us when we point it out, we "are playing the race card" . Do they really want to be us?

The spookiest cemeteries I ever visited hold the victims of the Cultural Revolution in China.? You are staggered by the number of names in each: estimates that under the Mao regime close to 100 million Chinese perished as a result of Chairman Mao's decisions and/or proclamations. ? Most of the cemetaries have been obliterated to make way for the new China, only 3 or 4 intact ones still exist I think.? What's horrifying is the young Chinese have no open history of what happened and no idea how awful and scary life was there as recent as 40 some years ago.? Many teenagers claim little to no knowledge of the Tiananmen Square Massacre and that was 23 years ago.\r\n\r\nHistory forgotten is history unlearned.? Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.? America exports most of its horrors in wars.? China keeps it's horrors at home with bloody revolutions and savage autocracy.

But there is, because the bible has been used to make terrible arguments in the past, and it's making another such argument today. Truth be told, the bible has a lot of horrendous, terrible, and primitive lessons. It even promotes things that are illegal today. Take a look through leviticus. The bible certainly should not be used as a grounding for one's moral compass.

Well, here's that October Surprise we were all anticipating -- Meat Loaf has publicly endorsed a candidate running for higher political office for the first time in his long, storied career, and that candidate is Mitt Romney.? \r\n It would seem that Romney now has the very basic framework of a working band - Ted Nugent on guitar, Meat Loaf and Kid Rock trading vocals. We need to find him a bassist and drummer quickly, although I suppose the Romney campaign could go all Doors on us and have a keyboardist stand in for the bassist.

Why invest your money in securities, real estate, or private equity when you can fold it once and stick it in your pocket or under your mattress where you can be assured it will never grow or work for you?? Solid advice.

If the principal is focusing on changing the dancing, changing the music, and adding more adults to the equation, the school might as well get rid of student dances and let the adults decide how they feel the kids can act. The adults start screaming sexual assault when they see someone touching their kids butt, and then the administration and the parents decide that it would be the best solution to completely take over the situation. What happened to kids want to be kids? The reality is that all of these adults were doing a lot worse things when they were minors. The administration needs to focus on the drinking problem, rather than ruining dances for the whole student body. Dancing is not, and never has been illegal. If the Principal is really more worried about the way kids dance than the kids who are falling over wasted, they don't have their priorities straight. Also, dances are the sole source of income for the student council of the school, and not allowing kids to dance is definitely going to impact the people trying to take leadership in the school.?Work with these kids to find a solution. If all you say to the students is no, no, no, they will definitely just plan their own dance elsewhere. And then the problem definitely won't be addressed.

Everybody should know that you can or should post impressive gains when you're going against nothing. Our recovery as a whole has been absolutely poor----nowhere near what a normal recovery should look like. GDP growth, slow and low. Employment, too little, too long.?Housing, be years before it returns to anywhere near normal. All the money the fed has poured into the economy---does everyone see huge inflation coming. If you want to hold the course, this is it. Just not good enough. Most folks want more and better for their kids than what they had. Do you see it coming or are we passing massive debt to the next generations? I don't like this administration or it's policies. They're interfering far too much in our free market system. BO, to me, has been lost since day one. This Benghazi business just exemplifies the buck passing. Hillary did it. No, Panetta did it. Everbody but the guy who should have done it----BO.

There are jobs galore in the Williston area of North Dakota. Type in Williston to see jobs.? I am 67 years old, retired but drive school bus part time.? One of our drivers got a Class A license and believe it or not made $125,000 last year driving a salt water truck.? The lowest paying jobs are McDonalds and they pay $15 per?hour to start.?? If you don't believe me, get in your car and find out for yourself.? The last time I looked, there were over 400 jobs and no takers. \r\n? \r\nGo out there and work this job for a few years until the economy picks up and you will have weathered the storm.? There is no age discrimination out there.? They just need workers.

And the laws your talking about all came out of the best congress money can buy . And the Feds has gave wall streert free money at the fed window .

What was great about the Who singles story had nothing to do with who you got them from and everything to do with your not returning them-- that sense of being overwhelmed and passionate and attached to them was what struck me. \r\n Quick Google search finds an AP photographer named Jean-Jacques Levy who was active from at least the late 40s until at least the late-70s. He definitely spent time in Europe and also had at least some passing knowledge of music. Scroll down this page to see a pic of Charlie Parker by him:?http://goo.gl/bK9JG

I love cemeteries - it is the only place where you can find some respect and peace as well, literally! We live ( really ? ) in a modern world thanks to technology, in which people have lost all kinds of respect in the name of modernism. Values are lost and self respect is under siege because money has replaced education. People have ( if they ever had anyway ) lost civil manners. Cemeteries at least make people reflect on the purpose of life, when they find themselves there. But, as soon as they leave ( that place, I mean ) they soon forget what they honestly might have felt - which could it ? be an instant of illumination!

How do I know?? Years later as a parent I saw it written in black and white. ? Lewd conduct was just too broad of a term back in my day.? The school officials couldn't do squat to me when I was lip-locked outside-yet-leaning on the building.? If my son or daughter were to do what I did in high school they would be in deep doo-doo with the school officials.

I know it's been awhile back but when in the Awesome 70's I attended a lot of concerts and they didn't give a rats **** if you took thier pictures, smoked p**, drank. It was the 70's. Most the time u could even get a back stage pass to party with them. They we're out to make us happy. I know security reasons u can't do that now but these people need to lighten up. It was a camera and a phone and even if there was a picture. Who cares? The amount of money they charge for tickets is crap. Most people can't even even afford to attend them anymore due to the cost. And depending on how close he was it may not even came out. Get a life Mr. Prince..... And everyone else who thinks they? are woth 2 millon dollars. \r\n? \r\nI seen Lynard Skynard/Moody Blues for $10.? 2 1/2 hr. concert? Those we're the good ole days.......

Congress is Americas greatest enemy!! The American people need to bypass congress and set themselves up to directly decide what we have for government.

I didn't even look at the ad.? I just looked at her and saw a teenie looking, unintelligent, tattooed ignoramus and wondered who would be so bad off to have given her a "first time."? Maybe she isn't talking about real sex.? And she is so young.? Maybe Obama has screwed her for her first time, but not literally.? He has screwed more than 300 million Americans in my way of thinking.? Still, he hasn't done any worse than George, Jr.? And, Romney isn't going to be any better if he wins.? I see nothing positive about this election.? I can't vote for either one with a clear conscience.? But, I am asking all to PLEASE VOTE AGAINST ALL INCUMBENTS on November 6, local to national level.

Reduce the speed limit about 100 yds from the bridge (like a school zone) with clear warning signs.? Then mount 2 laser sensors at the bottom of the bridge pointing outwards at a height of 11' 7".? When the laser sensors are tripped, have crossing gates (like railroad ones) come down to block the appropriate way.\r\n?\r\nAnd if that doesn't work, then put two toll boths on either end, and charge any too high truck that wants to go through $50,000 (payable by CC only).

I used to put up signs, both large and small, when working in three separate campaigns for my assemblyman, two for the assembly and one for state senator.? All three campaigns saw vandalism of our signs, often knocked down for miles, defaced or completely removed.? All the while, I NEVER saw our opponents signs treated this way.? Need I say my assemblyman was a Republican??? And we are called the haters.? Go figure.? By the way, it never worked.? My assemblyman won two terms in the assembly and one in the senate and then returned to private life, not running for a second senate term.? His replacement was...another republican.

So now we are expecting these young adults to act like adults when we still treat them like children? Not a huge fan of grinding anyways, but isnt this a dance for the students? Shouldnt they be able to make their own life decisions and learn from their mistakes? Obviously preventing the illegal activities such as under age drinking and the use of narcotics is less important than instilling these "good" morals? Sounds to me like we are slowly creeping towards turning our public schools into public prisons.

Do away with the Republican Party because they no longer represent the people of this country. They are all out for them selves for power. This is the worst era of Republican politics if one can call it politics. I call it a take over of this country by them.

I think race does affect this election, in many ways.? In many more ways than it should.? Race clouds our choice as to who really is best for our country.? It should never have anything to do with race, but whites, blacks, hispanics, and even asians make it about race.\r\n?\r\nThis particular study, needs other studies to back it up.? One study saying "it is", will be refuted by the next study that says "it isn't".\r\n?\r\nEither way, "it should" never make any difference.? I vote on ideas, nothing else.

In my opinion I say HIP HIP HORRAY to Howard. All the neighbors have shown for their reasons, which can be just a walk away from them if it is so important to see such scenery nearby, is that they like seeing what their neighbors are up to every second of the day. That is not their business. As long as he is not doing anything against the law or against them leave him alone. You should have let him have his little barns to do a hobby he really wants to get into. So now he has a large tall hedge that looks like it is quite trimed nicely and he has his privacy back from alot of neighbors that only want to see what he is up to. They do not want to be friends. JUST NOSEY PEOPLE...Let him keep his lovely hedge. I salute you Howard for the unique way of saving your privacy and sanity.

We of the diverse nation known as the UNITED States of America are fully aware of our history, SKYCOP68 and not the story you choose to tell. ?Racism was rampant on both sides of the aisle in the 60s, that is true. ?Since then, it has been clear what party the racists have landed in. ?Southern Democrats, those who did not wish to support civil rights, clouded their racist leanings as Democrats, but always voted for a Republican president (the South has leaned Republican for years, let us not kid ourselves). ?When it was no longer convenient to call themselves Democrat because we elected a black President, these Southern Democrats quickly changed affiliation and gravitated toward the conservative leanings of the Tea Party. ?The his-story comes in how folks as yourself choose to tell it.

I think that the ad is pretty clear. He's not from Sorth Dakota, wasn't educated in South Dakota, hasn't worked in South Dakota, hasn't lived in South Dakota, is over-qualified to represent South Dakota and if elected, probably will immediately get bored with being in South Dakota (like some Alaskan governor we all know), and seek a larger office better suited to his ego, background, and experience. And he represents a failed experiment in globalization with all?the fancy pants places he has lived throughout the world, an economic experiment that has mauled the American economy. He is probably a firm believer in out-sourcing, in-sourcing and all that H1B visa stuff too.

How does race affect the election??Whites vote for Romney, blacks vote for Obama. Yeah, it looks like racism really is pervasive here now doesn't it.

someone, what war did FDR start, not WWII, the Japs and Germans started that one. FDR just made sure we won. Eisenhower started our involvement in Nam.? North Korea started the Korean War, Truman just happened to be President.? You want war starters, try W. Bush and Cheney, that is very obvious.

No, because woefully ignorant humans far outnumber the people who want to protect these creatures..\r\n?\r\nThe answer to this problem:? simple, affordable, easily accessible contraceptives (in conjunction with sex education) so these people who are struggling just to survive aren't driven to kill or capture endangered animals.\r\n?\r\nOf course, that'll never happen;.??It's?"God's will" that everyone procreate - even if they starve in the process.? Religious nuts?of every denomination are responsible for most of?the suffering on this planet?throughout human history.? God help us.

Wow! An honest Republican that put the facts out there in plain view. I am not enlightened by this admission just confirmation as to how little Amerikkka has actually changed. There are bigots on both sides of the political aisle. It's just that the Republicans don't try and hide their true character. They can't stand to see a black man in The White House. It's the Amerikkkan way. Today, tomorrow, and for ever.

Yea look at your president when talking Racist pig,, he even slaps his white mother in the face for political gains in the black communities.. Calling America the New black America, If anyone in the white community called it white America, the racist pigs flying the race card would come out of the wood works.. I never even knew what Racist was until I seen it all around the black communities as their way of saying . OH we are so picked on. The?Sharp-ten racist pigs the Jessie pigs who cry racist ?every little time they want their 5 minutes on the news and media.. ?this country nothing but?separated?in all your Racist?categories. Sounds exactly like some other racist people who cry race all the time to destroy each other, Muslim countries and ours is on the same path of race wars, ethnic wars because as we see in black neighborhoods, they even kill their own kind, fill them full of their poisons , but of monkeys who should be living in the jungles swinging from trees

Think Romney consciously lies and summarily "forgets" ('Romnesia') in the insulting, mistaken belief ?that voters are unable to differentiate between his day to day - "All over the map"- inconsistencies. ?Unfortunately for Romney ?he simply does not ?possess the type of charisma that ?President Obama does - the inspirational brand. ?Sorry Mitt... you either got it, or you don't ?AND lies are a poor substitute ... z00m1

Indeed AlyJohns. How often did she not show up to session? Many reported times. Guess she maybe had to drive the speed limit instead of going 70mph in a 40 many times and never pay her fines. SD is much more than farmers and ranchers. I did all the things she did on the ranch-mow hay, work a few cows-but also obtained a nice degree and am well traveled. She lives in a little bubble. And I am quite tired of her recorded phone call babble disturbing dinner and family?time.Someone posted they wish they had her--please take her..

Now days a trip into the woods is like going to your local grocery store, people are everywhere. i would not give up living in alaska for a million dollars.

Tess. Well said, now that we agree, They do pay part of his taxes so therefore do have a say in what he can do on his land that is classified as an "agricultural preserve" he pays less taxes on it, and tax money is used to keep the land pristine. That land classification is also the reason he's being denied to build on it. So his neighbors tax money is used to keep his land pretty and pristine, yeah, I think they are owed the view for their money.

I think TODAY'S Republican Party is full of racists and Christian extremists and anti- government. TODAY'S Republican Party is not the same "Grand Old Party"! \r\n The Grand Old Party did believe in individual civil rights and small government, and freedom of ANY religion and freedom FROM religious persecution. TODAY'S Republican Party suppresses civil rights, based on religious beliefs, they are PRO- Christian, they are anti-environment, against the people and for the corporations and wealthy. They are not for the Republic for which they used to stand. \r\n I think TODAY's Democratic Party is more "republican" than the Republican Party.

As an actual resident of SD. Noems IS the biggest joke we've ever sent to DC. She has never stepped foot in college and it shows. She skips meetings for the things she supposedly fights for and then tries to say her spending time with fundraisers is more important then doing her job. She's done nothing for SD and the only things she's proposed never worked because they all were bad!

Rusty, that is simply poor planning and design. They can and should have raised the railroad trestle. That bridge I talked about our city engineers rebuilt, it too is a railroad trestle. And it?isn't one of these cruddy 2 line trestles, its a?10 line freight and 2 line regional transport and built almost entirely of stone and they didn't dig it out since drainage is an issue. The simple fact is it is poorly designed.\r\n?\r\nThe drivers are 100% at fault for hitting it. If you look at the people that hit the bridge were almost?all driving rental trucks, small business box trucks, or campers. These are generally the least experienced of all professional drivers.

How can you at all be impressed with Noems experience? She never went to college, she doesn't know anything outside of the ag business, and has skipped most of those meetings to spend time with fundraisers. If her job was to just make money sure she may have experience, but when it comes to actually DOING something and making a change she falls up very short.

Who cares, to me racism is one of those things that will never change. there is always going to be someone who hates you?because of?your skin. It is just as much racist as 2008 or 1990 or 1960,there can be white racist, there could be black racist. Racism is everywhere,and it does not matter? what color you are.

The first 2/3rds of this ad makes it seem like Matt Varilek is a well-traveled, educated, up and coming politician who has delt with both global issues and the DC political spectrum. Meanwhile, the ad showcases Kristi Noem as nothing more than a housewife who has stayed in South Dakota all of her life.? \r\n And for those of your who think that a candidate who has been in South Dakota all of her life is a GOOD thing, well then...might I take the opportunity to tell you that you have no concept of how economics work, how federal (meaning through DC) funding goes to States and how global policies and markets work to affect the US market and US policy makers on a federal level, which in turn, affect us at the State level. ?When you're only just stuck in your South Dakota bubble, you really have no one else to have for the $127 million deficit that you're presently running.

I'm surprised that Noem didn't mention that she won the beauty contest for the newcomers to DC since she was the winner. Naturally, she doesn't want to be known as a Washington insider so she pretends she's in-state looking after her constituents.\r\n?\r\nHer ads and pictures are ridiculous. She finishes a speech and then tucks her shirt into her blue jeans. Her political pictures show her, gun in hand, out hunting.\r\n?\r\nShe forgets to mention that she has sucked millions out of the federal govt. for their family ranch, but once she won the Congressional seat, she just turned the ranch over to her brothers and claims she gets nothing from it. What a gal! Just gives up her share of the family ranch that is heavily subsidized by the same govt. dollars that she doesn't want to be spent.\r\n\r\nHer tea party attitudes are over the top, but she lives in a state that sucks up her political rantings and will vote her back in office without a thought about how she wants spending brought to a halt, except for the things she personally wants subsidized. She's a joke.

Boy you make absolutely no sense whatsoever....on here preaching from some 'pretend' bible that you and the priest that molested you made up and then come on here completely unprovoked making comments about Michelle. YOU are the reason people tend to steer clear of bible bangers Joey, as you are quite talented in the art of talking not only out of BOTH sides of your mouth, but out of your dumb A$$ as well......what did you give up on the bible versus and are now trying comedy?? Here's an idea, stick to posting about what you actually know about, which in your case would be a butt load of nothing, so guess it's been 'real' bumping into you and hope not to ever hear from you again.....

No,? the fact is if Obama wins reelection taxes will raise to unsustainable levels.? The President says that taxes will raise on families earing above $250,000 annualy, the reality is if he wins taxes will raise for families earning more than $50,000 annually.? Obamacare is designed to encourage the reduction of the "level of benefit" in health insurance plans through the use of Taxes and Penalties.\r\n?\r\nObama wants the title, power and privilege of the office, he doesn't want to do the work commensurate with the title, power and privilege of the office.\r\n?\r\nThe absolute most important issue of this election is the economy.? Romney has the experience, skills and drive to succeed.? Obama is better suited to hosting a talk show.? His friend and Sycophant Oprah Winfrey could make that happen.

The reason he moved there, instead of next door to an oil refinery, City dump or "Gentlemen's Club" ...? could be that he likes the view, maybe the charms of the site or just the fact that its a nice (rich) neighborhood - that should tell you that? you (he) ?didn't do it by yourself, its not yours and he made it for you so you'll follow his rules. Now the government, local or national can tell you what you drink and how big it is. \r\n? \r\nNew people come into a rustic neighborhood - where it still has that "small Town" flavor - with kids playing in the streets, Sleepy weekend morings. \r\n? \r\nThen they only want to buy two home sites, tear down both houses, build as house bigger than?a Wal* Mart and host parties where 300 - 500 people are using every street in town to walk to the house - then stagger back to their car after partying for 2 days. \r\n? \r\nThats not why those people move there... They were trying to get away from the trash driving El Caminos and tossing beer cans in the front lawn, settng up a gun rang in the back yarrd, pissing in the front yards of the houses next door. \r\n? \r\nHe should have looked at the restrictions .. Before he moved there. I have no sympathy for bores, idiots or Cheese headed Nuevo rich. You can move out of? the Projects, Trailer parks or suburbs - put the things you were running away from; were people just you. Money don't buy class.

The racism in the GOP was the conversation at dinner tonight. I said that with all the folks using? racist remarks came from some "prominent" Republicans. John Sununu, Sarah Palin . Of course anything coming out of Palin's mouth usually just shows her ignorance. As to the rape comments by GOP members is outrageous. When I got on the internet the first story that caught my eye was the one from Wilkerson. It just reinforced my opinion.

Many of the people claiming to be Republican nowadays do have racist leanings. ?Just the idea that Republicans feel they have to "Take Back America" is indicative of the fact that Republicans felt someone took away the American that they knew and they want it back. ?Some Republicans also believe they have to take back the White House. ?Where did the White House go? ?Did the black folk come in and wreck the Big House, huh boss? Do we "shuck and jive" too much here in America? ?Are we just retarded? These are the words of your leaders, your pundits, your pollsters, and your men and women on the street. ? The beauty is, these words are not new. ?These are the things that Republicans said when you wanted to take back your schools during bussing and integration. ?These are the things that were said in California when white police wanted to take back the streets. ?the only things that Republicans don't want to take back are sports and entertainment (unless a white kid in the suburbs wants to listen to Li'l Wayne and then you rally to take back what our kids listen to).? \r\n Those who are considered minorities by these same Republicans are slowly becoming the majority who have voices and can shout out loud that we will make the difference for the future. ?So watch out! ?You better take back America before it looks like the melting pot it was built to be. Scary, huh?

I watched the video not once but several times and I can see the reasoning behind it. Maybe for most of the people not from the upper Midwest have a hard time to realize the conservative down to earth morals and commitment we have and support. Kristi Noem has real ties to South Dakota when her challenger Matt Varilek has been following his idol Al Gore.

Because you are an uninformed voters, as are most on here. As an actual resident of SD i've researched her "work" if you can call it that. She's skipped over 75% of all the meetings during her time. She knows nothing except the ag business, so farmers and that's it. She is lowly educated and when she gives speeches it shows. She's a joke to SD and shouldn't even be there.

You've got to be?taught to hate and fear;\r\nyou've got to be taught from year to year;\r\nit's got to be drummed in your dear little ear;\r\nyou've got to be carefully taught.\r\n?\r\nYou've got to be taught to be afraid\r\nof people whose eyes are oddly made,\r\nand people whose skin is a different shade;\r\nyou've got to be carefully taught.\r\n?\r\nYou've got to be taught before it's too late;\r\nbefore you are six, or seven or eight,\r\nto hate all the people your relatives hate;\r\nyou've got to be carefully taught.\r\n?\r\nThis song lyric was written 63 years ago by the great Oscar Hammerstein II for the musical,?South Pacific and when the show toured the south, there was an uproar. Does anyone really think we fought a Civil War?over cotton? We fought it to free human beings and they were worth the effort. Some in the south still call it "the war of aggression that took away their way of life." Slavery.?And that's because those misguided people have been "carefully taught." Sadly, they're?teaching their?children, who will teach their children. Same thing is going on in the ultra conservative?Islamic right, they're teaching their children to hate. The line in?South Pacific that precedes the song is, "it's not born in you. It happens after you're born." They're talking about prejudice and Oscar Hammerstein was right. We do not come into the world this way. We have to?be carefully?taught.

hahaha then you dont know republicans very well, I am sure this close to an election they dont want to be taking any chances with their voters to being sympathetic to gay people. and? all it would take in any rally Mr romney holds is for the tea party members who also attend these for one of these gay men to speak out? they would make sure they were tossed. everyone know what the tea party republican feel about any one other than straight whites

who do you think is paying for o-care? the tax payer!!! dah!!!\r\nit will be hard to get a doc's appt.? doc's will be paid less, therefore you will get less care in the long run,? it's much deeper than "free health care"\r\namericans need to stop expecting freebies\r\nhow can we be a strong country when all democrats want is governmental dependency of it's citizens and promote class envy.

Credit ratings are a scam to raise interest rates. If enough people would walk out the door when the loaning institutions say they are going to check the credit score, the banks would learn to avoid them. I can post a credit descrepency on your credit report and you have no recourse except to have me correct it by proving me wrong. Too late damage done.

I don't know if Mitt can do any better or not, but I know Obama has only made things worse.? How intelligent was it to send every taxpayer a whopping $40?? That wasn't enough to buy a bag of groceries, but multiplied by all the taxpayers in America, it surly did add to the deficit.? Right off the bat I knew he was an ecomomic idiot.? I don't particularly like Romney, but I have already cast my early vote for him because we need CHANGE!!!

Take that little knife looking thing on the toe-nail clippers, wedge it up under the ingrown part, pry it up until the whole ingrown part is sticking out above your toe, get some tweezers and grab it before it folds back down, peel it off using the tweezers.? Keep doing that until you have all the pieces that were ingrown peeled off.

raceisium is alive and well, i am a hispanic and i have lived all my life being discriminated against from white people that feel that they are superior to blacks and latinos. if we want tp get ahead in life or at work you have to prove yourself (3) times over? a white person,?if you go for a loan to the bank you must have (3) times the amount of collateral. white people feel superior to us. look at this election. it is not that our president is not doing a good job,it is that he is black and the whites can not stand that he has a superior position than a white. yet blacks are superior in sports of all kinds, and latinos are getting ahead in professional positions, latinos are the fast growing population and what do the republicans do is to try to discourage them from voting.white , get used to what is really happening in the world.

It took over 4 years for Obama to show his supposed birth certificate after being asked.? Why did it take him that long?? I am not a computer guru, however, give me 4 years and the expertise that the people working for him has and I bet I could come up with a pretty good forgery.? Ask yourself something else.? He has been asked to show his college papers and passport for several years and he will not show them.? Why the secrecy?? If you have the papers that people want to see, why not show them?? Why cause all these problems?

It is a no-brainer for you because you are not using your brain to see the truth.? Romney is NOT going to get Roe v. Wade repealed.? That will never happen.? Although he does believe that the issue of abortion should be left to the states--not be a Federal issue.? Leaving it to the states does not endanger women in any way.? And it is insane to think that Romney or the GOP in general is somehow going to do anything that would hurt women.? If anything, women will be better off economically than they have been under Obama.? Did you know that Obama actually pays his female employees a lot lower than any other President in recent history?? Obama doesn't care abotut women or their issues--he just gives lip service to get your votes.? If you think Lily Ledbetter was a triumph, then you are very ignorant.? All it did was extend the time people can file discrimination suits.? The biggest beneficiaries will likely be lawyers.

Reply to "STABKOFF" \r\n? \r\nThat's Mr. Idiot to you! \r\n? \r\nWe're still stomping through the Middle East. What credible, tangible evidence did the "Bush Regime" have to justify a full blown war??? \r\nThe "Bush Regime" only had 1 unreliable?imformant, who later said he LIED. And he said he had an agenda. \r\n? \r\nWe STILL haven't found any WMDs! \r\n? \r\nIf you want to invade the Middle East, then just do it! I couldn't agree more, just don't lie to us about the motives! If it wasn't for the United States, that oil would still be in the ground. \r\n? \r\nThe only things we did were... \r\n? \r\n1)?Destabilize the region.  \r\n??? a) When you create a power vacuum, that opens the door for any religious zealot to seize power. It's happened over and over again, country after country. \r\n2) Lose the admiration and respect of the international community. \r\n3) Raise the price of crude oil. \r\n??? a)With the West's economies?being so dependent on crude oil and the emerging economies of the Near and Far east becoming dependent on the same crude oil. The law of "Supply and Demand" comes into play.  \r\n??? b) Why in God's name would we start an un-founded?war in?that region of the World??? \r\n??? c) Any brain-dead idiot should know that if a gnat farts in Texas, the price of crude oil goes up!? \r\n? \r\nThere's always a better way to accomplish our goals. Bullying smaller, weaker countries IS NOT one of them. Covert action to neutralize potential threat is the best. The NYPD could've done that. \r\nThen we could place "Friendlies" in power. \r\n? \r\nThe "Old Days" of military action are long gone!  \r\n? \r\nWith Korea and Viet Nam we fought using "Jungle" and some "Urban Warfare", with the Middle East it's "Desert" and more "Urban Warfare". And ever since World War?II, propaganda and covert persuasion has been used to sway the hearts and minds of our emenies.

And at Vic Derelict58: I was referring to the Redwall series by Brian Jacques, not Bambi. ?Try them out, they're great books. They don't get talked about as much but I love them, I recommend these titles in the Redwall series: High Rhulain, Pearls of Lutra, Martin the Warrior, and Mossflower. There's a Redwall t.v series, it's based off of three early books that Brian Jacques wrote. It's not completely accurate to the books although its still great. I'm reading another great series: Watership Down by Richard Adams.

Uh - yuh...? I am worried.? In all of my years, I have seen meteorologists' dire warnings not come to fruition, at times.? This is in the back of my mind, of course.? However, the remainder of my mind is freaked right out about what Mother Nature COULD do.? I live in a condominium high-rise where we cannot utilize gas or charcoal grills; when the power is off, so are we.? I wonder whether there will be 911 calls coming from my building; I wonder whether streets will be blocked off, due to downed power lines.? The whole thing is a bad trip, frankly.? To live one's life looking forward to the middle of a week is not productive; is there a choice?

Please excuse my ignorance.? But, aren't we talking about Columbia University and?HARVARD here???? Like, Hate,?Agree, or Disagree with Obama.??But,? I would imagine that SOMEONE would have exposed the truth about an individual lying about graduating or attending HARVARD.? Let alone claiming to be the president of the Harvard?Law Review.? Their school holds high standards, so I would think that it would be?embarrassing to the university of someone went this long?and was not a?legit student.? Let's put aside our differences, just for a moment.? Think about it, if you or I made up a story that we graduated HARVARD law.? And we ran with that let's say for just a month.??Every media outlet would have us for dinner.??TMZ would destroy us.? So, let me understand this correctly. ?I am suppose to believe that a previous Senator and?PRESIDENT of 4 years, has been lying all these years?about attending One of the top Universities on the PLANET !!!!!!? All these years, nothing was exposed.? Nothing ever came out.? Follow me here.? So we are talking?since 1988?this guys has been playing the system.? And I know we have heard others lie and play the system before.? BUT, the world did not know of them.? They might have been fake?doctors or lawyers in their community.??But, a Senator of the United states ?!?!?? Then The President that?has served for almost 4 Years?!?!?!?!? ?And this is Just now coming to surface???? ? And We are suppose to believe this.?? Now I will be the?first to admit.??I respect Donald and Mitt for their business sence.? They are proven smart guys.?At least in Business.??in my opinion, running the country is not running a business.??But,?I can understand how some may feel it is similar.?I see positives?and negatives within?BOTH parties.???But, come on my fellow american citizens.? This is just?silly.?If it were that easy,?we all would?have degrees from Harvard.? I don't believe Harvard would allow their reputation to go down the drain to Hide anything for popularity of a PRESIDENT.? Especially, for someone claiming?to hold a?presigious honor as the president of their Law Review.???I do not know?who sounds more silly.? Is it Mr.Trump for knowingly, causing controversy in a world that lives and?dies?for it.? Sounds like another PR move.?

That is the most ignorant statement I have ever seen.? The Republican Party (despite the efforts of the hardline?"moral majority", which was more like a minority when it came to certain issues,?in the 80's) is mostly made up of good people who do not judge others on stupid irrelevant characteristics.? You forget that the GOP?was?founded on the belief of equality for ALL under the law.??Unlike the left, the right views people as individuals and each individual is to be judged on the content of his or her character.? It is the left that always categorizes people, puts them into boxes and labels them.? The left judges people based on broad labels...which shows their petty?prejudices.

Think again,? Romney will repeal Roe v. Wade? (he has said he would and the Supreme Court is sitting different 40 years later) and make abortions illegal except in cases of rape/incest. If a woman is raped and impregnated, she must prove she was raped in order to get an abortion. If the man is charged, it must go through the? courts before it is proven and that takes time. In cases of incest, it must also be proven with DNA and that happens only after birth. Republicans are proposing panels of judges to speed up the process. It is not fearmongering. If he has said he would leave it up to the states, then he has lied...again. In Virginia, a woman must go through an ultra sound which the republicans tried to make it a vaginal probe ultra sound and the Governor was prepared to sign. BUT if he does leave it to the states, there are 27 republican led states that this scenario could be a definite possibility. AND DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT ANY WOMAN WHO BE ABLE TO SAY SHE WAS RAPED AND RECEIVE AN ABORTION WITHOUT PROOF. You are so delusional if you think this can not happen to your loved one.

I can't believe the despect shown to both these ladies. Shame on you who did that.? One is our First Lady like it or not; the other is a fine lady, wife, other & grandother like it or not.? Of course, they were supporting breast cancer month both with good reason!? As to Mrs. Romney not hugging people, like Mrs. Obama, this may sound lame, but I understand fully.? She has MS & every touch & hug hurts like heck.? It has been terrible for me, but I have had to back off from hugging everyone but my husband, kids & grandkids.? I was a preacher's wife expected to hug everyone & I just got to where I had to go with pats on the back because of it.? Maybe you should give her the benefit of the doubt before you criticize.? The old walk a mile in her shoes...

This is just the sort of thing that shows even the Republicans feel they can¡¯t win on the issues. So they have to resort to getting Obama out of there using underhanded Lawyer type techniques. Gee Republicans acting like Lawyers, what a shock. This happened during the last election also and look where it got you. The loss of all credibility. ?You¡¯re even chasing people away from your own party especially by constantly making what should be social issues into religious issues. Unless you keep up with the times your party will eventually die. As the years go by the voters will be more and more progressive and the old style of thinking people will die off. \r\nIn all reality what both parties need to do is come more to the center. It will never work if an administration is far to the right or far to the left. It will never work if Congress is working against the President out of spite because he¡¯s not in their party. Our country will never survive unless we can find some middle ground.

I'm one of those mis-fits who firmly believes that having a Gun in your home for use in situations like this, is justified. My issue and opposition is with/to those who want to walk around carrying a weapon while sitting in the Coffee shop, rambling around in the Clothing store, seated in a pew in Church, waiting at a crosswalk or Bus Stop, riding public transportation.etc,.................?? You are the Goons who can best be described as "Wishing to boost your Ego". If having the Guns on your side or in your purse, (which I believe you have a right to), offers you and your loved ones protection as you claim, why hasn't ANYONE IN THE COUNTRY, this great land of ours carved out by our forefathers, creators of the Constitution giving us the 2nd ammendment right to "Bear Arms", done ANYTHING to assist these many victims that we read about daily who are being massacred by some "Gunman" in SO MANY LOCATIONS around the country. Where are the stories of the "gun toting bad-*****s" who've come to the rescue, who with their Glocks, and AR's and whatever the hell else, stopped the carnage? THERE ARE NONE!!!! There will NEVER be Any!!!!. If ANYONE of you ever found themselves present during these massacres, and shootings of/at motorists from moving cars, from Highway overpasses, and let's not forget Colombine, Lee Boyd Malvo, the "Dark Night" screening in Colorado, What would be the result? Just more Carnage!!!! \r\n?\r\nI'll ask that you give me a reason to believe that carrying a gun in public affords you with protection. \r\nCRIMINALS AND "NUT CASES", along with our Military nor any other opposing faction will NOT ANNOUNCE their intentions beforehand. If ANY of you "Believers" used common sense, you'd?REALIZE?that the most important ELEMENT of any attack is that of SURPRISE!!!!!!\r\n?\r\nKeep brandishing them, polishing them, bragging about them, and showing them off. That's all they're good for unless you want to emulate George Zimmerman.

Wrong, that is NOT what he said at all.? He said that abortion should be up to the states.? He NEVER said he would try to make it illegal,.? He doesn't even want it to be on the Federal level (hence the comment about wanting to repeal Roe v. Wade).? But even if the face of the Supreme Court were changed, it wouldn't make that much of a difference.? We have had times when the court was conservative but Roe v. Wade was not repealed. It is not thta easy.? No, you are delusional.? Nobody would make such a requirement to force someone to testify in front of?a panel of? men.? Stupid.?? By the way, not every Republican is against?early term?abortions.? And many of us still aren't.? It was only when it had been pushed by the left (the Progressives who incidentally support eugenics)?further and further toward the acceptance of partial birth abortion and legislation that wouldn't do anything to protect babies who survived abortion, that the right started to fight back harder against the whole abortion issue.? The left has gone from saying abortion should be "safe, legal and rare" to saying it should be "commonplace, easy to get under any circumstance and acceptable all the way up until birth".?? I have never heard of anyone saying a vaginal probe should be required...that sounds like more lies--especially since that could endanger the fetus.? But what is wrong with requiring an ultra sound?? I think women should be fully informed about what they are doing.? I know it is a hard decision to make in the first place for many women, but should they not be absolutely sure and fully informed as to what they are doing and know the real consequences of their actions?

I have a college degree and I have no problem with people having an education. However, I also know that simply having a degree or even having multiple degrees doesn't mean you're necessarily a good person.\r\n?\r\nLook at Varilek's history and you will see that he got his education to further his employment. While that's not a bad thing, you'll notice he was using his degrees to sell carbon credits and lobbying the UN to mandate the market. Carbon credits are a scam, so I believe that Varilek is either?not a good person or just gullible. I want my representative to be neither of those.

2 to 1 he is a latent pedophile. They dont like gays because of the confusion in identity. And there is no correlation between the gays and pedophiles except they both have sexual preferences, the gays want other gays and a pedophile wants a child and only his god would know why. My God passes on that one.

Invest in your family and friends. Yeah, I know.....financial advisors advise against that...because THEY want to lend to your family and friends....and charge them HUGE interest rates-----using YOUR MONEY! Yup! The money that the banks pay you a paltry 1/2 % for the then loan out for upwards of 6,7, even EIGHTEEN PERCENT! \r\nCut out the middle man banks, and loan your kids the money to buy a car, a house, etc. Charge them less than the banks rates, yet more than what the banks will pay YOU. Loan your neighbor the money for that boat, loan your nephew the money for college and to HE// with the bank taking the lions share of everyones money. Most importantly, PLACE LEINS and GET COLLATERAL....just as the banks do. It's a win-win situation for all....and let the bankers starve and the banks collapse. They do NOTHING but take everyones money and call it theirs. It's YOUR money. Use it wisely!? DON'T get your financial advice from the banking and investment community. Their only advice is in THEIR interest...not yours.

you say you've successfully timed the market... over a seventeen-year period? (17? !!!) \r\nThat statisically did not happen.??No professional has been able to accomplish what you say you did.? Nobody.? The best and brightest out of Wharton, Stanford, Harvard ...?? None of them have done it.?? And this baloney about staying in getting people in trouble?? Let's look at the last seventeen years for example.? The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 4755 on October 26, 1995.?? Last Friday, the "DOW" closed at 13107.?That represents a gain of more than 175%.???Your "in and out" approach likely did not go up 2.75 fold. If you believe you did that well, go ahead and apply for a position with Goldman Sachs, and good luck with that.

Exactly the same thing I said in my post! Obama wants the US to turn into a dictatorship with him as our amazing and wonderful leader who gives us our food, housing, OBAMAcare,etc so we can praise the great idiot Obama while he and his ugly wife live the high life in designer clothes, gourmet food, parties with Jay Z and Beyonce, etc. Anyone that puts his own name in a healthcare reform really has some narcissim and egocentrism going on. I guess the money fairies are going to pay for that free healthcare...O wait, it will be those of us who do have jobs and work and pay our bills paying for those who are poor and less fortunate with 5 or 6 kids.

It wasn't diverted because of the "elves"; the actual term would be "land wights" - which are, essentially a form of elf. Remember that Iceland was predominently settled by Vikings, and that is part of their lore and faith. Anyone who is knowledgable about or follows the Norse tradition could tell you about it. Avoiding the boulder is no different than preserving a spot because of historical or Christian significance.

I hope they do...Zuckermans net worth is over $300 billion. Why should we be supporting one persons wealth, when he could be donating portions of his finances towards organizations like Breast Cancer, St Judes Hosp, and other organizations that have a major impact on societies best interests.

It was on the news as a fake as well.? I wish there were some laws passed so that campaign ads could only spout the truth and no lies or half truths or stuff taken out of context.? There are too many ignorant people who believe some of that trash.? There should also be laws on the amounts of money for a campaign as well so our presidency is not bought and paid for by big business and we wind up with a puppet they pull the strings on--hence, Romrat.? Sorry, I see bad things if he's elected and women will pay dearly going back to the 1900's almost on taking charge of their own bodies etc.

Um, when most people speak of a "creator" and "souls", they are referring to their god, and since you ended your post with the words "amazing grace" (another religious reference) I am certain that is the "creator" you were speaking of in your initial post.? I'm sure you left it ambiguous just so you could fire back saying "oh, I didn't mention god."? I'm not antsy.? I just find it annoying that some assume that everyone believes in some larger than life creator or supreme being.? Many of us do not.? My opinion is that there is no "creator" aside from my mother and father, so unless you are referring people setting their "souls" right with their parents, lol, not everyone is going to agree with you. Of course, I don't believe in "souls" either so I don't know why I would think it right to set my "soul" right with anyone at all.? \r\n\r\nIn terms of closure, just because YOU don't think it does any real good to know what happened doesn't mean that many close to the victim don't feel the need to know when they lose young loved ones tragically and unexpectedly.? Knowing what happened will not bring them back, but for some it may help them to move on.? I speak from experience.? Sometimes one of the worst things is not knowing the why or how.? If you never know, you may torture yourself the rest of your days wondering if there was something you could have done.? Sometimes knowing and having closure does help some move on regardless of what you believe.

The Japanese are so deep in culture, that's one thing lacking in the U.S., culture. We just grab at the newest latest fades that come along, no real in depth culture. Culture is a way of life, not just a belief. Like when you grow a garden it must be cultivated. The weeds need culled, etc. Culture is based on removing the un-necessary and maintaining the necessary. Focus, goals, ambition, refusing to accept failure, this is their culture. To cultivate, if you will. Americans are caught up in division, ie: religion, justice, politics, discrimination, crime, that's the basis of our culture or the lack there of. Maybe that's why they're leaps and bounds ahead of the U.S.........Culture.  ?

i think unless you ARE part of a culture being represented wrong then it's hard to understand WHY it's offensive to those cultures. Its similar to the N words now a days in that at one point in history it was used as a general term for a certain type of minority. Not only was squa used but it does mean bad things toward native women especially.? Its rude and if people use it theyre either very old or very uneducated in that way. Also its maddening because its a HUGE Misrepresentation of Native american culture culture (of which there are MANY) \r\n\r\nI grew up near a reservation and the majority of people were native and no one even more traditional people loo anything like this and no girls braid their hair pigtails and brown clothes and the only time you wear moccasins is for ceremony and special things and they arent like the awful costume. To who ever said so what they still have the chief one thats offensive to, to a cultures higher up but its not as demeaning as the word squa for a native girl costume thought up BY white people. No way will racist gross misrepresentation costumes stop but the labels must be TRYING to be sensitive and accurate on SOME level. Its all fun until its YOUR culture paired with bad language

Never mind that average life spans in the US are constantly going up, people's quality of life is always going up, largely due to better nutrition and work by groups such as the FDA that keeps our food safe and our drugs at least some level of legitimacy and efficacy.\r\n\r\nBottom line, Vaccinations = GOOD, FDA = GOOD, quacks on the internet telling you not to get vaccinated and that organic is better = BAD.

<exasperated sigh> You claimed that when you were in Catholic school the nuns "did stuff?like that (ie. stuff like this preschool teacher did)?to me all the time". You then said that "it must have worked 'cause when I see the imbecile posters online who can't spell or construct a sentence or think, I now know it was all for the good". I'm asking why you seem to think that the "stuff" the nuns did to you?caused you to become so much smarter than the "morons online"??If that "stuff" hadnt happened to you do you think that you wouldn't be as smart as you are today? Do you think that dumb people might not be as dumb if that "stuff" had happened to them? All i'm asking for is a shred of evidence that that "stuff" does what you claim it does.  \r\n? \r\nSo let me rephrase my original question in the hopes that you might answer it. \r\n? \r\nWhat is the connection between having that "stuff" happen to you as a child and your intelligence in your adult life? That's your claim. THAT is what i am asking.

While morally terrible, it was marriage based on false pretenses.\r\n\r\nJudges are not there to say what is morally right, merely legally based upon the culture's laws. Those of you who allow your moral judgement to alter your perceived form of interpretation of the law illustrate just how shitty of judges you'd be. Great people yes, shitty judges though.

justme080582, you are so misinformed is not even funny. Tax evasion? Mitt will not release his last 2 years of tax returns because if he does we will know how much of a tax dodger he is and he will surely lose the election. This man has tax shelters in the Caymen Islands. In Swiss bank accounts pays less than 14 percent compared to 30 percent of a middle class worker and founded Bain capital a outsourcer of thousands of American jobs. He or his kids never served in the military but yet he talks aggressive about our foreign policy? Why is he behind 30 points in Massachusetts, the state where he was governor? What do they know about Mitt that we don¡¯t? Use some facts and critical thinking skills and stop with the fox news talking points.

Yes. Absolutely.? Prostitution will never go away, and legalizing it will make it safer for both the prostitutes and their customers.? It can be regulated and taxed, which helps the economy.? There can be health regulation too, with regular checkups required.? Refusing to legalize the "world's oldest profession" is a head-in-the-sand approach.

Crying, this is about taking the guns out of violent gangs hands by dismantling their ability to make money. This is about putting women in a defensible position and about being able to track stds like never before. This is about decreasing the allure of prostitution by removing it from the list of forbidden fruits, and this is about the government making money off stupidity and infidelity. There are 0 downsides. Just look at Denmark, 40% decrease in VIOLENT street crime, not just the loss of prostitution, which wasn't a violent crime, in a short 10 years. Can you really counter argue that with anything other than "morals?"

I think any American that buys one of these cars are traitors. Until we can get Americans working at American companies again, we should purchase American made goods. As long as we let foreign companies push their JUNK here we are going to be at their mercy. Before you buy any more of their JUNK, stop and think "Do I really need that," and if you can get by without it, bank the money you would have spent and look for an American product. It will probably be better built and only slightly more expensive.

If you saw some of these brides in the "other" shall we say red states, you would understand totally why.? Most of these lower socio-economic-educa  ? tionally devoid states fair less well because they lack the insight that education brings as well as the income.? It causes much stress and in addition to that, most are shall we say, cows.

No one I know cares how Romney spends his money the only question is how he avoids taxes. If Romney didn't have offshore accounts and paid 20 some percent in taxes and wasn't presenting a plan that would drastically cut that no one would care. Why?would you care what Michelle or Obama spends?their money on?

Peter, we're not arguing the age gap. we are arguing getting that drug money out of gang members hands! We are talking about dignifying the profession and making it safe! And no, it removes credibility from the gangs. forbidden fruit is a lot less attractive when it's no longer forbidden. And we are talking about bouncer-defended, indoor institutions where anyone who checks in can be contacted if an employee comes up with an std. It's the ultimate safeguard you ignoramous. No argument apart from relativity of morals can even be brought against legalization, regulation, and taxation of prostitution.

I would tell her she needs to stop the next short bus and beg the driver to take her to a real school. But it's most likely too late, her retarded parents are probably brother and sister, and she's a retard as well. ?I hope for her sake there is public assistance in New Zealand because she will never be a normal functioning member of society.

Oh, Ms. Nguyen, couples had better talk about sex!? People want to act like it will just flow with all the love.? No, it won't.? Women are programmed way different and the modern lifestyle and the two wage earner household has wrought havoc on the matter of intimacy.? Women are taking on more than they did decades ago, and are tired and far more independent, a lot less accomodating.? This should be discussed, the frequency, the variety, the level of desire, etc.? Most men are starving in this department and feel guilty even desiring their wives who see sex as just another demand on thier time and energy.? Men are forced to turn to other means of 'closeness' and or intimacy which brings its own dangers into a marriage or they become depressed feeling unwanted and guitly for even having the desire.? This is so important and should not be overlooked.? This man and most of his buddies can attest to this.? It is parodied on t.v. and in movies, but it is real and important.??Why do you think the pornography industry thrives the way it does.? Talk, sex and be clear and honest, but let the demonstration do most of the talking which to some is a moral issue, but it should not be skipped or taken for granted.

"Get any"? Get any what? This is an example of why it is dehumanizing. You are making the point of using a woman for her "parts".?How do you not see the degradation in that? Do you really believe most of these women choose this occupation because it's what they dreamed of becoming when they were little girls? And yes, they were "little girls" at one time and could very well? have been your little girls. Does that make any difference to you? Being your sister, your niece, your grand-daughter? Most prostitutes are streetwalkers - they are not escorts or high-priced call girls. Most enter into prostitution because they were sexually/physically abused as a child. Does this make you feel "like a man" to use one of these women?knowing that many have little choice when they sell themselves? Or are you so desperate that you don't even care?

Tabby...awesome story. Whoever decided to take care of these "ducks" should face animal cruelty charges but my guess is, if caught, they will not be held accountable because the town wanted the animals removed. Where I live a Wildlife Officer was shot and killed after stopping a person suspected of poaching deer. In an ironic twist, the park service later decided to dispose of the same deer population on the same day the?alleged?killer's court appearance made the front page. Rather ironic and a total oversight to report them inches apart if you ask me.

it is such a shame that this little boy had his friends killed, and hopefully the person or persons who did this will realize how they hurt an innocent child. That may never happen as there are a lot of just mean people who feel it is their right to do whatever they wish to do, no matter the consequences to the innocent. As for the parents, they need to go to the city officials and ask for their understanding and if they can get replacement animals. Some towns are allowing poultry as people have come to rely on the fresh eggs coming from a known source. In this case a possible case could be made that the child could be allowed replacement poultry given his needs as an autistic child. It would be very hard for the parents to explain to any child such a senseless act, and given his special needs just about impossible. It is up to the parents to do what they must with the help of people who understand the needs of this child. If the parents get the okay to get poultry again they must do everything possible to insure the chickens etc are females, no crowing roosters, and that they keep the pens clean and away from neighboring homes. A huge concern of city officials are the noise and smell of chickens that are not kept in clean pens and are allowed to fly, which can be curtailed with wing clipping. I do hope there can be a good solution, but wonder if it wouldn't be better to look into a therapy dog, which seems like a better choice than poultry, which no matter how clean, can carry diseases. just a thought.

People that have a strong faith tend to be happier and they tend to remain married longer, not sure that is a political statement.? However, polls have shown that Democrats tend to consider themselves Spiritual, but are less tied to a certain denomination and there are more athiests and agnostics among Democrats.? This would tend to suggest that for Democrats religion is of less importance than it is for Republicans.? Furthermore, a previous entry stated that Democrats are better educated.? Actually, educators tend to be Democrats, but Republicans tend to be better educated in the general populace.

What Romney is proposing sounds very similar to Reagan's " trickle down economics " where you give the break at the top and magically the middle class benefits with more job creation. Unfortunately, the rich just kept the extra savings. This policy did not work for Reagan and it won't work for Romney.\r\nI'll stand with Big Bird!

I recall how the VW Beetle initially turned the American car industry on its head. When folks were saying the same kind of things - oh it's junk, no one will buy it, etc - young people and people on limited budgets went out and bought them in droves. Why? Because they were a sturdy but basic cars and they were affordable. Soon, it became not only normal, but "cool" to own one. I would not go out now and buy a car for over $25K, which is what?current new compact cars now cost. However, I WOULD go and buy a reliable car for local transportation for under $10K. I think a LOT of students who need transportation and have $40K in student loans will buy them as well. As with the original Beetles, the only market resistance is that they ARE NOT AVAILABLE. ?Import them and we will buy them!? Let the snobs fork out a small home mortgage for a car. Give us inexpensive basic transport. Remember that even those $25-35K models are being recalled, so don;t tell me BS about "quality."

No it isn't. Romney wore expensive shirts and clothes until running for president. The fact he talked about buying 3 packs of shirts at Costco?when they didn't sell them that way proved the lie.

Tata Motors.\r\n? What will the Oil Companies do to stop it?\r\n It is an auto engine that runs on air. That's right; air not gas or diesel or electric but just the air around ... us. Take a look.\r\n Tata Motors of India has scheduled the Air Car to hit Indian streets by August 2012\r\n The Air Car, developed by ex-Formula One engineer Guy N. For Luxembourg-based MDI, uses compressed air to pu**** engine's pistons and make the car go.\r\n The Air Car, called the "Mini CAT" could cost around 365,757 rupees in India or $8,177 US.\r\n The Mini CAT which is a simple, light urban car, with a tubular chassis, a body of fiberglass that is glued not welded and powered by compressed air. A Microprocessor is used to control all electrical functions of the car. One tiny radio transmitter sends instructions to the lights, turn signals and every other electrical device on the car. Which are not many.\r\n The temperature of the clean air expelled by the exhaust pipe is between 0-15 degrees below zero, which makes it suitable for use by the internal air conditioning system with no need for gases or loss of power.\r\n There are no keys, just an access card which can be read by the car from your pocket. According to the designers, it costs less than 50 rupees (approx. $1.12 US) per 100 KM, that's about a tenth the cost of a car running on gas. It's mileage is about double that of the most advanced electric car, a factor which makes it a perfect choice for city motorists. The car has a top speed of 105 KM per hour or 60 mph and would have a range of around 300 km or 185 miles between refuels. Refilling the car will take place at adapted gas stations with special air compressors. A fill up will only take two to three minutes and costs approximately 100 rupees and the car will be ready to go another 300 kilometers.\r\n This car can also be filled at home with it's on board compressor. It will take 3-4 hours to refill the tank, but it can be done while you sleep. \r\n Because there is no combustion engine, changing the 1 liter of vegetable oil is only necessary every 50,000 KM or 30,000 miles. Due to its simplicity, there is very little maintenance to be done on this car.\r\n This Air Car almost sounds too good to be true. We'll see in August. 2012

Isn't prostitution already legal in Vegas?? Tax it like any other service, implement health inspections, and it becomes a winning situation for all concerned. Here are just some of the immediate benefits to legalized prostitution:? Better control of STDs (savings is less hospital space being used for treatment), keeping that many out of our overwhelmed jails and prisons (very costly), putting some (not all) pimps out of business, and the government makes money.? maybe it won't yield a profit, but the money generated could be used for other purposes.\r\n?\r\nIt won't eradicate the illegal side completely, but it could make a big difference.? Prostitution, legal or not, will never just go away, so instead of our government only spending money on trying to?arrest, prosecute, and punish, at?the very least the savings will be from not using other government resources.

You dimwits for Obama. Every tax ever passed gets paid by people buying. It doesn't matter if you make ten dollars or ten million. Businesses past the cost to the consumer. The Fed govt already taxes gas at 40 cents per gallon, if you raise taxes on gas it shows up in gas and everything else that requires gas to transport. Now lets also force interest rates near zero... this steals money from the seniors that have saved and invested for their future and only helps those who are in debt or want to borrow... Lets print more money. More money devalues money and causes the price of goods to go up, it's called inflation. Sorry, the govt does nothing to help people it only rewards the stupid and lazy. Nothing forces personal responsibility and change like pain. It's not pleasing to say but true. Without hard work and sacrifice there is no appreciation for what one has...

I think so. Then, it could be regulated and taxed!!

I feel it should be legal for the simple facts that #1 no matter if its legal or not men will seek the company of a prostitute at some point in his life. #2 Prostitutes can be monitored for controlled health prevention and taxed for the monies they earn. Face it Prostitution is the oldest profession in civilization.

TR Rose, that's only if you're married, America is a secular nation, and you can't legislate morality. Better to tax bad morality, remove power from street gangs by creating a highly regulated system, and making a system which keeps women safe (bouncers) and tracks stds like never before? There are no downsides.

Geez, talk about clueless.? Think about it, people, this is obviously intended as a "watch-list" for girls, so they can avoid situations that put them at risk of rape.? It is saying, in effect, don't walk alone, don't leave your windows open, don't take a drink from a guy you just turned down for sex, etc.? It isn't a joke and it isn't a guide for rapists.? It is intended to help the girls put themselves in the mind and perspective of a rapist, so they can see that a situation that seems innocent and normal to them might actually be putting them at risk for being raped.? The part about doing lots of rapes to get better at it seems gratuitous, but it may be intended to convey the message that if a guy has a reputation for "not taking no for an answer" then you should probably not go to his room alone with him.? One would assume that would be automatic, but kids sometimes don't think the way adults do, so maybe you can't be too careful even with warning about the most obvious risk factors.

"If ever the U.S. were to rethink prostitution laws and regulations, they might look something like the law Sweden enacted in 1999. The Kvinnofrid law made it legal to sell sex but not to buy it. That is, prostitutes couldn¡¯t be charged with a crime but their clients would be charged, as would traffickers, pimps and brothel operators. "\r\n?\r\nWhat the heck sense does this idiotic law make? So now we're writing inequitable treatment into law (i.e. only the jons get prosecuted?)? Is that what?the feminazis and liberal wussy boys' idea of progress is?

Absolutely yes.? It's naive to think that men should be able to suppress their desires if they are unable to attract a woman.? Better to have them pay for the services of a willing professional who is routinely regulated by the state than to commit some sick sex crime with an innocent woman or child.\r\n?\r\nStreetwalkers, pimps, addicts, runaways, and predators now service this market, leading to addtional crimes, and the spreading of diseases.? Plus, they tie up the courts, the police and the jails.\r\n?\r\nControled prostitution, along with SEVERE penalties for pimps, etc.\r\n?\r\nWe need to get smart about this.

Well actually, you are very close.? There is no such thing as the 'love' they portray in Hollywood and in the music videos.\r\n\r\nLove is actually defined as, "The intentional and freely given act of working toward the well being of another."\r\n\r\nBasically, it is a decision.? One interesting biblical quote states, "Love your spouse."? In other words, it is a command that can be acted upon.? Something that you can be advised to do, and then decide to do.\r\n\r\nThose that say, "I want a divorce because I don't love him anymore" have no idea what love is.

I agree with your thought but someone already killed the others and they were fighting city/town officials to keep the animals. In other words, getting more may bring the same result. Rather stupid for the city to complain though, unless they were keeping a rooster or somehow the chickens wandered free. If I were the parents, I'd look into getting the kid something he could keep as a traditional pet. It is possible it would not have the same effect, but you can interact with a dog way more than you can a chicken. People really are the worst creatures on this planet.

I'm not sure I agree with you that her age has nothing to do with it.? Sometimes, older people take a little longer to express themselves.? And, I'm not calling her old, but she isn't a teenager, thank God!? She is younger than me, so I'm not putting her down for being 60.? That is a plus!? Now, I completely disagree with you that Anything can be summed up in about 3 minutes.? Maybe she was summing up in ABOUT three minutes if she had been given that little extra time.? I attended a meeting where traffic light cameras were being discussed.? I never got to speak because I did not know I had to sign in to talk.? However, had I spoken, I could not have said what I wanted in three minutes.? I had intended to point out the fact that corruption exists when ONE person from the police department determines who gets a ticket.? If it were done fairly, I might agree but with the plan they had and still have I think, other police officers, their families, lawyers, judges, commission members, state officials, etc would not get a ticket while the single mother of four working two jobs to survive would get one.? That is simply WRONG!? Traffic tickets for the most part are selective taxation.? I also wanted to mention my disagreement with professional courtesy, which agaiin is wrong.? If a police officer, not on an emergency call with lights and siren activated, violates the law, he or she should be ticketed as any other.? I know it would cause problems withitn the department but I had a suggestion to handle that too.? If a seperale agency to police the police were created, it would pay for itself.? It could start out small, with maybe one office (neitehr city, state nor county) were assigned per county to watch and ticket violating officers, that would eliminated the 'brotherhood' squabbles that would result from ending the professional couttersy.? Also, as I understand, if an officer is ticketed, no points is assigned against his or her license.? Is it any wonder so many people who won't work wish to become police officers?????? Now, what I've said even here could not be adequatedly stated in just three minutes.? ONe last comment.? If you are going to stick with the three minute time frame, even quantum mechanics should be cut off at 180 seconds.? If you extend that, let the lady talk.

The concept we are working under is that no one knows how, where or when a gigantic disaster will occur, but if it happens in America, America will take care of it. That's how it is supposed to work. It is un-American to believe individual states should be left to defend for themselves, just as it is un-American to believe an individual American should be left to defend them self. This concept even has a name. It's called "The United States" of America.

Oh please....what were they going to arrest her for........boring people to death?? No wonder there is so much bullying going on - the kids are imatating the police. I have bad knees and couldn't have gotten up off the floor either without my hands. The older I get the less I am treated with respect. I hope she sues the pants off that police department.

So the next time you say whore, ask your self this. WAS YOUR MOM REALLY THE WHORE EVERY ONE ELSE SAID SHE WAS, OR WAS YOUR MOM DIFFERENT BECAUSE SHE WAS YOUR MOM?

Being in the film industry since 1968, Hollywood is desperate for $$$$$$$$$$. Disney is about the only company left with any money to spend on buying out whoever! The digital age is now in full swing in the movie theaters. Prepare for the end of going to the movies as we know it. Theaters are in worse trouble than Hollywood! They put me out on the street after 25 years of nights, week-ends, and holidays. No thank you's, nothing! My reward was replacement by digital projection & un-employment at age 60. I hope Hollywood goes right down the toilet like TITANIC!

It is always interesting to me how when someone disagrees with President Obama, there is a large contingent of people who will automatically cry racism, but when it's pointed out that 96% of blacks voted for Obama, it doesn't seem to be an issue... \r\nIf all your wonderful ideas were so valid, why didn't Obama make them happen in his first two years when he had a majority in both houses of congress... \r\nIf it makes you feel any better, I would have voted for Condaleeza Rice for any political position, including president.... \r\nBy the way, Abraham Lincoln was a Republican...

If you are not part of their clique then you are not welcome, and your opinion does'nt matter.\r\nWe the people do not have any right's anymore, and alot of the law's imposed on us are un-just, and you may not even be aware of them, or think you understand them and your right's only to find out you are sadly mistaken.\r\nIn the state of Wyoming you don't have the right to tell someone repeatedly to get off your property, and when you get close enough to look them directly in the eye and happen to touch their fat stomach in the process they can charge you with battery 17 day's----oh yeah the person asked to leave was a town employee, fully supported by the Albin Town Council. So maybe sometime's it takes longer then three minute's to express yourself, Lord know's politician's NEVER are long winded.

Yes. If police lose the ability to calmly resolve situations without always resorting to arresting the public, especially where there is obviously no criminal intent nor? justification?for dragging?a person to jail, then they increase the likelihood that the public will react with violence?in the future to any similar interactions with them, So actually encouraging people?to?escalate to more unacceptable behaviors.\r\n?\r\nFor the public will rapidly learn, police will not use reasonable discretion?to resolve conflicts. When an organization put into place to protect the public can't be trusted to do so, then chaos rules and the public will often turn to itself to seek protection. With anger, mistrust and blame focused on the failing police, regardless how many do try to perform their jobs well. The perception is what?affects?the masses?most.

Real glad Lucasfilm was sold to Disney and nothing else. \r\nI guess when "fans" like to constantly critisize George Lucas's work (after SW episode 6) this is what it leads to.. retiring and selling.\r\nPeople keep talking about "money" "money" "money" but honestly, if everything youre making is making people talk crap all the time what else are you going to do?? "obiviously" people doesnt like it.\r\nyeah, he SOLD his work, hes allowed because he created it and deserves what he gets! and if thats money then its money, he worked hard for it. so i give props!!\r\nDisney will do a great job!! theres no doubt.\r\nand the most important part is the fact that STAR WARS WILL LIVE ON.\r\nonly true fans will see that, instead of talking more crap.

I don't think getting things going the day before is to soon at all. Now you have me Questioning wether you should be incharge of FEMA or not. You sure missed it with Katrina. Where were you this year in New Orleans? Obama had to get your butt moving because you didn't want to move.

Been to Italy many times. These homes are not?your typical middle-upper middle class home/apartment. My friend's family is from a town about 30 miles NE of Venice called Portogruaro. TRUST me these homes belong to multimillionaires...  ? .that avoid taxes like the plague! The average college educated kid lives at home with an extended family?mama and daddy, etc.?and is working on their terminal degree since there are no jobs and forget about selling a house that's why it stays "in the family"!

This is a great time for Disney as a whole, Not only for Star Wars, but The Indiana series. We all love Harrison Ford but the next chapter should have him passing the "torch"? as it were, to His next in line. But "NOW Disney can really that Star Wars to a new level" And really put the Star Wars universe in The theme parks. My Love forever is and alwas has been "Disneyland" But finding room will be a might tough! But (bite my toung) Disney World is where the should Do a Theme park of it's own, like Harry Potter at Univesal Orlando, I mean they do hves a little extra space there ?! only time will tell.

There were ten embassy or consulate attacks during President Bush's term. Dems understand you can't stop insane people from blowing themselves up. Carter, Reagan, both Bush's, Clinton, and Obama have ALL HAD TERRORIST ATTACKS. If stopping these attacks is so easy...how on earth did the rapublicans fail during 9/11. W Bush was in office for seven months, had intelligence supplied by the FBI, and did nothing. Benghazi was a mistake, the president took FULL responsiblity. Will it happen again...an attack by nutty islamists somewhere near our embassies even under Romney...you bet. Politicizing it is just incredibly lame.

I'm not saying what Birdlow did was right, but this needs to be investigated to the extremes. The officers should have their feet held to the fire and have the flames turned up to the maximum.? Their job was to bring this man to justice in a Texas court of law. This could happen to either one of us.? The?people of America?have a right to know the whole truth as brought forward by a Texas court of law.? What if the good rev has been doing this for years?? What if every seemingly good deed?that the rev done ultimately had bad motivations?? What if the good ole rev is a freak?hiding?masquerading in a preacher's uniform?? What if Mr. Birdlow had never committed a crime in his life?? What if this was the first time Mr. Birdlow had ever done anything wrong?? What if Mr. Birdlow has been the most careful of his duties to God, but he does not wear a preacher uniform?? We needed to know these things.? Birdlow may very well be the victim here.

Braindead repuke nuts. Your leaders warned you about this lyin Mexican Mormon Moron tax evading draft dodger during the primaries. But you did not listen.\r\nAll pathetic, psychotic, braindead right wing radical cracked teanut dopes should listen to your leaders. They warned you about the Mexican Mormon Moron tax evading draft dodger during the primaries when they were able to tell he truth about this moron. \r\n \r\nLyin Willardo, the Mexican Mormon Moron tax evader, bankrupter, draft dodger, job outsourcer and Etch A Sketch Champion may have vision of going back home to Mexico. \r\n \r\nAll braindead pathetic right wing radical cracked teanuts should listen to your leaders. \r\n \r\nRick the Dick Santarium has brainwashed his followers, the evangelicals and the gay rapist, pedophile catholic priests that lyin' Willardo is a member of an evil cult and is the anti-christ. He also told them that lyin Willardo is the worst person in history to ever run for the presidency, can't be trusted and will destroy our country. Groper Nutquist, the boss of the right wing cracked teanuts and Nut Gingerhead, the criminal lobbyist, totally agreed with the last three assessments. \r\n \r\nSo most of the evangelical sheep will probably stay home on election day or some may even vote for Obama. They are totally scared to death of lyin Willardo, the Mexican Mormon Moron tax evader, bankrupter, job outsourcer, draft dodger and Etch A Sketch champion. \r\n \r\nIf this repuke draft dodger ever became president, and war broke out in the middle east, he will be putting his dog on the top of his car and fleeing to his birthplace in Tijuana and hide in one of his 4 grandmammy's (pappy's side only) outhouses.

I think that's a great idea, since you can always use your contributions for their college fund, if they go, and use your sheltered earnings for your retirement when you reach retirement age. A Roth is always a great way for anything, like an emergency fund or college, etc., since you can always take out what you've put into it, penalty free. You just can't take out the earnings on your investment before your 59 1/2. There are other ways to get some of the earnings out without penalty, before retirement, but I won't get into that for this response.

Watch out Christians and Catholics.

The Mormons deny the Trinity and the existence of a literal burning Hell, yet they promote polytheism (many gods), baptism for the dead, and the notion that Jesus and Satan were originally spirit brothers! \r\nThis is what Todd Akin thinks of lyin Willardo, the Mexican Mormon Moron tax evader, bankrupter, job outsourcer, draft dodger and Etch a Sketch Champion.

Don't much care for the guy making the comment I do think his point was that the biggest reason Obama has appeared to be on top of things is pretty much because of his complete and total bungling of Bengazi-gate and his and Bidens?ridiculous response to the father of one of the our Americans murdered. Obama coudn't look that father straight in the eyes and give any kind of true and sincere condolences and he couldn't reign in that big mouth moron Biden from so rudely asking that same father "did your son always have balls the size of cueballs"?. He know ?he screwed the pooch with his "VIDEO lies", and has NO choice but to show up during this storm if he doesn't want to totally blow any chance he might have of winning the election? I'm sure he'd rather run off to Vegas if he could get away with it!!!! And before any of you bitch, this is my opinion, don't care about your response, and am a Independent voter, not repub or dem!!!

NO!!!!!!! Rules are rules, follow them or stay out. Hand cuffing is to prevent physical outbursts as well as to protect the public and officers involved. In all likelyhood she has no issue wearing cuffs at home for fun. All to often the Police allow situations to get out of hand before cuffing, this was textbook perfect. The best way to stop a problem is to end it before it starts. Don't like the rules in America? Youi have the freedom to leave, I am sure China or Iran would welcome you with open arms.

Let's wait for Romney to win and have another major hurricane and FEMA has no funds to help because Romney cut funds to help pay for the tax breaks for the rich. Has everyone forgotten that Romney suggested cutting fund to FEMA? It's amazing how so many people have selective memories during election time.

Smartpeople,\r\nAt least, even some one as loopy as you has to agree that any human, even PweeWee Herman, or Borat would be a better, more intelligent President than the idiot Obama, who said he will move to the 57th state and become a corpsssssman when he is kicked out of the Oval Office next month.

So Romney's not just a liar...but a danger to Americans as well. Remember when he said he wanted to cut the number of firefighters as well??? Romney's so out of touch, I expect him at any minute to ask people to move to their summer homes until the disaster is over.

Elizabeth Ryan, you are reading controversy where there is none. What I'm saying is that PETA is 100% hypocritical for placing the value of a fish's life above that of a human baby murdered by its physician in the womb of its mother... the one place where it should be the safest.\r\n\r\nFour of Jesus' Disciples were fishermen, and Jesus helped them catch fish before they became Disciples. I'm sure you have eaten fish in your life. How many babies have you dined on? We have, by God's word, dominion over every other creature on the earth... including fish.

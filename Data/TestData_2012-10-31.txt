I think Brown has some nerve judging how President Obama handled this situation after the flub he and Bush made with Katrina. I think "early" is the key to give the local governent the support they need in time of crisis!! President Obama is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't these days. He responded to this crisis the exact same way Bush should have when Katrina happened. I think he should shut his mouth and crawl back into whatever hole he was in during Katrina.
1
Why should Obama have stoop so low as to meet Trump's demands? Trump is just looking for an excuse to make him look good for the donations to the charities that he'll use in a tax write off. Same with letting Romney use his own private jet. Kick backs is all that Trump is looking for. Hey Donald! Don't you have a "Celebrity Apprentice " to put together?

Yeah, they got it!!!!   Excuse me, I said it before  and I will say it again.....Two and One-half was written for Charlie Sheen.  Why all the hoopla ..... Charlie's ego took him away from reality for a while there people, ok....but, if you want quality as before, bring the Sheen back!  Simple!  Ashton just don't get it.  The chemistry that was sizzling between the Sheen and the other actors on 2.1/2 was amazing.  It was lost once they let Charles go.  I feel that the Sheen has been chastised enough....we, the people, want the Sheen back!  Yeah!

I think anything that can be said that is positive for Christianity is fair game.  I deplore the Muslim bull and I'm sure people don't realize how dangerous this is to our country!  And you better get rid of Obama before he writes a Executive order banning future elections and crowning himself king of USA...

It makes me weak in the knees to think that all the yahoos who wrote in here are just the tip of the "low information voter" iceberg.  Huckabee's religious extortion is bad enough, but these dim readers using that as a platform to launch their racist, hateful lying is even more sickening.  & it IS racial hatred, combined with willful ignorance, plain & simple.

,     In fairness I think many had looked at his record,and were less then pleased.  Look at all the Republican primaries, where each of the "anti-Romney candidates" enjoyed a moment at the top.  Romney, though pretty by tch wanted by the party leadership among that mix, wasn't really a ghetto favorite among votes, who kept trying to find anyone but primary after primary...     At this point, it isn't so much who's great, but the whole argument has devolved to who people think of as the lesser of evils.  And though many have voted that way in the past; this election, and with the super pacs what they are, to actually campaign on that platform "I'm bad, but he's worse, vote for me"; what a sorry state of affairs we've ended up in.  Less bad then the other guy, isn't what people should strive and endevor to become.  That's actually worse then the student who just strives to barely scrape by with a D because it isn't failing.  At least there, someone isn't striving to be a bad person, just less of one :o     Sure I also have my thoughts about these candidates, and just how bad the parties (read plural) have become; but I don't fault people for chosing either of these guys.  It's practically as if the concept of running FOR something, is pretty much gone in this partisan climate.

Hey JeffC77, I wonder when the hopey/changey candidate will call a press conference to inform the American public about what really happened at Benghazi and why it took so long for the truth about it to be revealed--by sources other than the White House?  You know, as part of his boldly stated policy of "transparency".

Americans need to read, find out about issues, not listen to Huck, and Fox news.  It's disgraceful that they can openly tell lies.  Read the Bible for yourself, do not depend on those that will manipulate the words for their own purpose.  Read and discover the many GOOD things Obama has done for the country.  Do not believe what you hear in the political ads.  Think America, do not be led like a lamb to slaughter......

What is wrong with simply accepting the fact your kid isn't the best at a certain sport?  This guy needs a reality check.  As far as death threats go, unless there is real proof someone is actually going to it and not being a hysterical turd, ignore them.  Meet them in a dark parking lot and they change their tune pretty quick.

We all know who the real Romney is; a person that will say whatever a group of people he is talking to want to hear. Romney wants to get elected president and will say and do anything to get what he wants. If Romney gets elected it will be one of the biggest mistakes America has ever made.

"Heckuva Job Brownie” has become a national punch line…and so is Michael Brown. No matter what your politics are why would anyone listen to anything this JACKASS has to say about “reacting” to any kind of disaster, especially a Hurricane. If “Brownie” was listened to him Gov Christie would be on TV ripping the federal government a new a#*hole, and Brownie would never be able to travel to NJ.

I now see why this Country is falling apart, this Country was built on Christain values and I think we prospered and became a great nation because of it but those values are being dwindling.  I think back to the old testament when God would help build his followers great kindom's until they became immoral and turned away from Him.  Every time they would be destroyed!  I can see that happening right now with us and we better turn back to Him or else we know what will happen!\r\n \r\nThe Bible talks very clearly about marrige being between a man and woman, it also talks clearly about homosexuality being sinful.  So as a Christian why should I just sit back and let people do what they want when I know what God's truth is.  Just because I dont stand for these behaviors or stances doesnt mean I am judging.  What is going on is wrong in God's eyes which makes them wrong in mine also!  I can love the person and hate the behavior which many of you seem to have a problem understanding.  \r\n \r\nSome of you are saying we should just let people do whatever they want.  If thats your real philosophy think al little about what we would be with no laws and people doing whatever they wanted.  I have a feeling that country isn't going to survive very long.

I do find it interesting that he had time for a press conference and photo ops in the situation room.  It was all over the news that Obama was monitoring the storms progress up the coast from the situation room but it was never once mentioned that he was monitoring the Benghazi Terrorist Attack from the situation room.  He won't even say if he was in the situation room during the attack.  He won't even say were he was during the attack.  There were no photo ops and no immediate press conference.  The requests for help from the seals were denied.  Who gave the denial?  Did it come from the situation room?  Those questions will be answered sooner or later.  Someone or multiple someone's need to be prosecuted.

COME COME MY FELLOW BLOGMERICANS.....Nei  ​ ther of you (or I) would allow life to slip away when the chips were down.  Classic, take his concept of the individual helping the individual and apply it over to the Fed Helping the States. Or any of the states helping each other (such as after 9-11 when Calif sent cash to NYC) after a crisis.  \r\n\r\nWhat Thinker means is to take the "we are all in this together " philosophy and write it large. \r\nWhat works between neighbors works between larger entities, regardless of arguments which profess disdain for bigger government.  The truth is we all do need one another.  Arguments about saving capital over people is what I oppose. \r\nWithout People there is no Capital.  We have too long put the cart before the horse in relation to what is more important in the prime economic equation.  \r\n\r\nMethinks you are being a bit melodramatic my dear.  Please (as RIA says)\r\nBreathe deeply, enjoy the moment and relax.

So I guess privatizing will make it better? Cut out their pensions, cut the staff size and outsource it to china! After you sell off the shares to his cronies! Perfect! Like what the President is doing in this time, and would feel safer if you were in this disaster area, but wouldn't and won't vote for him? Must be because he is Black, why else would you vote against your own best interest and your own warm feelings of safety?

A better question to ask would be, no matter what the president did, isn't somebody going to complain? Perhaps being a former FEMA director, will give some people reading this post a clue. Ask Governor Christie, what he thinks about Obama's performance.

The following is excerpted from a letter that linguist Ives Goddard had published in the mid April 1997 issue of\r\nNews from Indian Country (p. 19A) on the origin and meaning of the word "squaw,"\r\n \r\nIt is as certain as any historical fact can be that the word squaw that the English settlers in\r\nMassachusetts used for "Indian woman'' in the early 1600s was adopted by them from the word\r\nsqua that their Massachusett-speakin  ​ g neighbors used in their own language to mean "female,\r\nyounger woman,'' and not from Mohawk ojiskwa' "vagina,'' which has the wrong shape, the\r\nwrong meaning, and was used by people with whom they then had no contact. The resemblance\r\nthat might be perceived between squaw and the last syllable of the Mohawk word is coincidental.\r\nSuch partial resemblances between words of different meanings in different languages are\r\ncommon and of no significance.

A Sharp  \r\nEffectiveness is a great word you used !  \r\nNot much related to FEMA or any "one"  group or area related to govenment.  Instead related to the "people"    You seem to suggest that theres no problem if 1/5 ( ? ) of the country stops in its tracks. So if the entire country is consumed provided there were ever a war ? Its ok ?  Its ok that  the country just comes to a stand still ? What happened when the northeast came to a stand still with the power outage  ( ?)  years ago ? \r\nThe east coast was hit by a bad storm yes....  Cant markets be diverted  to another city.. part of the country ?  Put all the eggs in one basket ..as with  911 ? With the power outage also ?

I'm excited at the prospect of new movies to share with my 9 year old son.  Looks like Disney already had a relationship with Lucasfilm, because we saw lots of Star Wars Stuff at Epcot Center this past summer and their Hollywood Studios park (which we didn't get to) has a couple of Star Wars-themed attractions.  I'd also love to see Mark Hamil, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher play their characters as older people.

re2chron7_14 Mitt Romney is your antidote to selfishness, LOL.  the irony is so deep in **** that I needn't bother with examples.  Mormons do maintain the values the country was founded on, unfortunately those values, specifically: greed, bigotry, cronyism and imperialism.  You RW morons tout the founders as if they were saints.  The founding fathers were imperialists who by hook, crook and violence took over this land, owned (and some even raped) slaves, restricted education and worked crony deals that benefited themselves at a cost to all, many of whom had no interest in their projects.  For you to ask others to read history is laughable.  You are a blithering idiot.  Since I'm certain you aren't a 'reader', here's a link to some videos that will simplify history down to your level.\r\nhttp://www.youtube.c  ​ om/watch?v=pCeHXLAI9  ​ 8A&feature=BFa&list=  ​ ULrMDP0Xm_VmY\r\nIf you do read, check out Zinn's "A People's History of the United States" to balance your faux news generated perspective on history.

President acted proactively and has been praised for his efforts by everyone actually on the ground there, incuding Chris Christie, who gave the keynote address at the REPUBLICAN convention. \r\n  \r\nBrownie, whose lame, late and ineffective efforts during Katrina were made far away from the actual disaster, has one heckuva nerve leveling criticism at anyone.  WHy did anyone even put a microphone in front of him? \r\n  \r\nIf he were still in charge, Romney would actually be right to say they should get rid of FEMA.  Must be why he changed his mind, or perhaps that's just because he always changes his mind or at least what he says.  Yeah, we need that kind of leadership, his and Brownie's. \r\n  \r\nVulture/Voucher and Vacuous.

Like most people who live in Mr. Trump's altenate reality, how can one be so wrong on so many counts! \r\n1)  The money wouldn't go to Obama, it would go to a charity.  (You can read can't you?) \r\n2)  He would have to have been from Kenya to move back to Kenya.  (It's called the English language!  Your wishful thinking does not a truth make.) \r\n3)  Even if any part of what you dreamers think has some grain of truth . . . Mrs. Obama (his mother) was a citizen of the US at the time of her son's birth, so her son would have US citizenship conferred on him regardless of where he was physically born.  (Somehow I don't think you say that all the children of our armed forces personnel born oversees are non US citizens?  (At least not to their faces . . . )) \r\n4)  If President Obama was thinking that far ahead . . . .   you and the "Donald" don't have a chance anyway!

Hi comrads, what is ignorance, an ignorant man will pay double for health care because he's afraid of change, an ignorant man votes for those who profit from you paying double for health care, an ignorant man doesn't realize Americans can save about $800 billion per year by going to a single payer health system. Because of ignorant men I pay $7,538 per year for the same health care someone in France gets for $3,696 per year, had ignorant people not blocked Single payer health care in 2009, we could all be enjoying an extra $3,842 dollars in our pockets each and every year. You Sir are ignorant and can't even spell Comrades right.

I wonder when people talk about religion if they really are talking from a position of educated intelligence or just using religion to spread their ridiculous agenda. If you have read the Book of Mormon, the Bible and the Koran and spent time discussing each with other scholars then I deem you an expert on the subject. Otherwise, shut your mouth and just listen to experts. And also if your voting on just one issue to limit everyone else rights, don't vote. We don't need narrow, uneducated voters.

Damned if you do, damned if you don't. That's how it's been for the best 4 years with Obama as President. When he does a good job his criticized for acting too fast "like this instance" if theirs a time lapse in his action his criticized for acting to slow. The American people are not blind and they don't forget either. Why doesn't anyone in office bring up the fact that even before Obama took office the Republican Party was already vowing to fight him on every issue that he would bring up. That just showed the American people who the Republican Party represents; the rich and the corporations.

It's not just the cat rating or the wind speeds, that get it the designation; but rather the size, and the sheer land mass of the thing.  To give an idea, while it made land fall on NJ, and was hitting NYC, Maine was also getting hit by this thing. \r\n  \r\nSo growing up in northern Jersey, my parents many times vacationed in Maine, the travel distance is some 500 miles, as the distance was clocked by the car's odometer.  If the radius of this storm was some 500 miles, then we're talking a huge storm here.  Others have said the water level in lake superior rose with this one, out by their house, when discussing it yesterday.  The storm wasn't directly over head to them...  The effects of this one were far afield from where it made land fall....

John Doe 2, V_L & DougYKW...\r\n \r\nWell-made points by all of you. The Bush/Cheney "braintrust" got us into two needless wars with the aggregate loss of over 8,000 young men and women, 68,500 injured and disabled and an unfunded $3+ Trillion bill that was left on the table for the current administration to try to pay for. Meanwhile Cheney's CEO cronies at Halliburton, Kellogg Brown & Root, Raytheon, Martin, DHS, Blackwater and others raped the US Treasury of $Billions in open-ended no bid contracts.That obscene tsunami of cash is now in the Cayman Islands, Bimini and Switzerland alongside Romney's tax-exempt hoarde from Bain. Yes, it is good to see FEMA doing what they are supposed to do and utilizing our tax dollars to help fellow Americans in distress, not the rich, the priviledged and the corrupt military/industrial complex. Thanks for your posts.\r\n \r\nPeace ~

I find it hard to take politicians who make these type of comments seriously. These same people who think no one knows about the money they think they are secretly taking and splurging on themselves want to open their mouths about some people who will receive assistance during a disaster? I do understand that there were and maybe will be people who will not spend their aid on necessary items, but to be an elected official making these types of remarks is simply disgraceful and heartless. If he does not like what they do with their money than maybe he should find a solution to what they can spend it on immediately after disasters instead of coming across as a hypocritical, insensitive dick..

Did anyone notice that 'Star Wars' is fictional?\r\nSome folks are taking this way to seriously.\r\n \r\nAnything done in the future cannot ruin the reality of the exciting and well-accepted appearance of the first three episodes (IV, V, and VI). Everyone has their opinion about the following three episodes. But let's face it, in the entertainment industry, your dollars do the voting. So whether you are some sort of 'Star Wars' purist who has lost touch with reality by demanding YOUR version of what YOU think makes for a good motion picture, the voting public will ultimately decide whether the upcoming serie**** the mark.\r\n \r\nHere's a little friendly advice . . . If you don't like the choices Lucas has made, or the choices that Disney will make, don't just sit there in your arrogance and criticize . . . go make us a movie that tells YOUR better story in a better way. Use YOUR OWN imagination and creativity . . . but first you might take a self-creativity test by lying down on a hillside and watching the clouds roll by to see what you see.

I think Huckabees add stinks --  it assumes democrats or Obama is not christian based on his self judging silly criteria . the funny thing about the christian right is they are trying to pass a Mormon off as having their values .

Personal observation is always the least trustworthy evidence (just ask any cop). There is always going to be a tiny percentage of people who scam the system, and there are always going to be lots of reporters looking for something sensational--or made sensational by extrapolating small numbers to large populations--to write about. Actual figures from investigations and studies, of course, do not show massive fraud.\r\n\r\nBefore welfare "reform" in the 1990s, for instance, there were lots of news stories (mostly on television; newspaper reporters, most of the time, have to cite legitimate sources) about generations of families on welfare. It turned out that the average family relied on welfare for less than three years.\r\n\r\nBut that doesn't make for a sensational story.

They warned you about the Mexican Mormon Moron tax evading draft dodger during the primaries when they were able to tell he truth about this moron. \r\n \r\nLyin Willardo, the Mexican Mormon Moron tax evader, bankrupter, draft dodger, job outsourcer and Etch A Sketch Champion may have vision of going back home to Mexico. \r\n \r\nAll braindead pathetic right wing radical cracked teanuts should listen to your leaders. \r\n \r\nRick the Dick Santarium has brainwashed his followers, the evangelicals and the gay rapist, pedophile catholic priests that lyin' Willardo is a member of an evil cult and is the anti-christ. He also told them that lyin Willardo is the worst person in history to ever run for the presidency, can't be trusted and will destroy our country. Groper Nutquist, the boss of the right wing cracked teanuts and Nut Gingerhead, the criminal lobbyist, totally agreed with the last three assessments. \r\n \r\nSo most of the evangelical sheep will probably stay home on election day or some may even vote for Obama. They are totally scared to death of lyin Willardo, the Mexican Mormon Moron tax evader, bankrupter, job outsourcer, draft dodger and Etch A Sketch champion. \r\n \r\nIf this repuke draft dodger ever became president, and war broke out in the middle east, he will be putting his dog on the top of his car and fleeing to his birthplace in Tijuana and hide in one of his 4 grandmammy's (pappy's side only) outhouses.

After this I would expect there will be a lot fewer sarcastic remarks regarding the rest of the country \r\nwhen there is catastrophic damage in the future...I Think this section of the country has been spared  \r\nthe serious damages that nearly every other section of the country has been experiencing quite regularly.

This is a clear case of being careful about what you say and just pandering to the base and making up BS that they want to hear, BTW both side do it, so it is not unique to only one.\r\nIn this case it was an ignorant thing to say. I agree we need to hold the agency accoutable and make sure that money isn't being wasted but we also need to have a centrally organized agency that can respond to things like this. Some more state involvement would be good but if you break it down to far you lose abilities that a agency at a federal level can handle. The worst of this though is suggesting a private company take over? Who would pay? Probably the government in the end. I'm sure this isn't what he thinks or totally how it would be but I could just envision a rescue team coming along to pick someone up but first holding up a credit card machine and saying swipe here. Sounds real good, sarc.\r\nI think its time

There may be things about BO's past that the Chump wants exposed.

You know, PETA would be a more respected agency IF they wouldn't be so stinkin' silly in many of their "endeavors".  I mean yes, PLEASE get involved if you see someone dragging a dog behind their vehicle, or if you see someone throwing rocks at kittens as they're being born....\r\n \r\nBut, instead, they keep making silly requests leading the average citizen to question their mental stability or drug usage.  PETA....grow up and stop being so immature!

Yes, they would have lost tourist dollars. Some people ONLY go there for the weed, so if they restricted that, those same tourists would just go somewhere else....like California, Colorado, or Michigan.

Why would anyone think they can postpone Halloween that would be like postponing Christmas Eve - Dec. 25th - Someone needs to remind people exactly what Halloween is - THE EVE OF ALL SAINTS DAY - November 1st. - A religous observation of all saints.  So are we going to postpone that too!!  I know that Halloween has been bastardized by most people but it really was a day that was observed by most christians - I understand that the little ones will be sadly disappointed by not being able to celebrate as usual - However, now would be a good time for them to remember exactly what Halloween really is all about.

Time to rise up and vote out the radical right wing cracked teapots and their oil, insurance and defense contractor owners. At least the people saw the light and realized how idiotic "Juiced Up" Sharron Angle and The Flying Witch Christine O'Donnell, Joe Smith from Alaska and several others were and did not vote them in. Hopefully, people saw what the real helicopter gunship pilot Sarah Palin is and will never allow her to hold any public office. The idiots who voted for these nutcases did not learn from Bush Bin Lyin and his criminal gang what the republicans are really about. They outed two CIA agents, who wanted to tell the truth that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Bush Bin Lyin's bosses the oil companies and defense contractors got wealthy as our society was being brought down. These guys destroyed Iraq and then had to rebuild it using tax payer dollars. At least they got Delay. Scooter Libby was the fall guy for the CIA agents outing. Don't forget the criminal gang's trickle down economics where the money trickled down into their bosses pockets instead of creating jobs. That is why we were losing over 700,000 jobs a month before Obama took over.

I have two businesses I'm working now, to build up for when I "retire" from my full-time job.  I'm an accountant, so I'm building my portfolio of private tax preparation clients - avoiding the tie-down of monthly write-up and payroll returns.  Tax prep can be done anywhere I have my computer. \r\n  \r\nI also sell Mary Kay cosmetics, and have been building my clientele for that also. \r\n  \r\nPlus, I mesh the two - many of my tax clients now are other Mary Kay reps, and many of my other  tax clients have become Mary Kay clients too, as they know me well, and know I would not sell anything that I don't use myself, and that isn't the highest quality available. \r\n  \r\nOnce I do retire, I will give up a 40 mile each way commute in exchange for the freedom to travel wherever and whenever I wish, while following my passions and  maintaining friendships and income.

Yes if the Rev Al Sharpton didn't say it .Its not true. You talk a bout hate & anger from the republican party .  What kind of people does it take to say that person has no rights to life  . Because they are to small to talk & i cant see them .They are hidden in there mothers skin. Would you say  [ Love - Hate - Anger] If you can believe that this world began with a big bang and every thing you see every morning you open your eyes. Then why do you hurt when one of your loved ones pass away. And for a short moment in life you will say well there in a better place. If you are talking about heaven  just to ease you pain or at that moment do you believe there is more to live than a big bang. But if you believe in heaven you need to read the book its better than the movie

I see a governor who cancelled infrastructure projects that would help the residents of NJ get home in time to participate in their families activities, while the state police flies him to his son's baseball game, nice one gov.  Then he declines funds to help the poorest residents in NJ to get medical care and maybe buy some milk and cheese, again while everything is served to him on silver platters courtesy of NJ taxpayers. I see a governor who goes on TV not to help the residents of NJ but to chastise them for staying in their homes during a storm, like they actually had the care and protection given to him 47hrs a day 365 days a year.  Yeah, way to go gov.

He should learn to keep his mouth shut. He acts like these folks are just sitting around waiting for a hurricane so they can get a handout. He is probably prejudice too.

The guy asking the question is a far cry from a "reporter". He is a Fox News "personality" who was trying to inject a political plug for Romney into the interview. Christie was rightfully annoyed and let the jerk know it in no uncertain terms. I have never been a fan of his but I am now. He is doing the job he was elected to do by the people of New Jersey and is working closely with President Obama to insure that everything that can be done, will be done. Both men should be complemented for their compassion and determination. That is true bipartisan behavior and the Congress of the United States should take a cue from these men of different parties but similar objectives.

Before we condemn the man to harshly should we not look at the words spoken and read what was said rather than grab bits and pieces out of context? I too have concerns when money is freely given after a disaster. There are still 1965 Mercedes running around Anchorage that were purchased with the relief money that poured in after the Good Friday earthquake of 1964. Not all the people that receive relief spend it on things they should not, however there are those that seem to go totally out of control when they have larger sums of money than normal; and those that are there to convince them it is the right thing to do. I am sure it happens in every disaster and other than good moral fiber will continue to happen. Look at the majority of the people that win the lottery, do they invest it and live happily ever after? Let me leave you with this thought. \r\n\r\n"I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians­. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ." Gandhi

Lets just all live off the 2% until they run out of money.  Forget about self-reliance, hard work, discip line, and personal responsibility.  Lets just turn our lives over to Obama and his omnipotence.  Wake up people!  We are on the wrong track, a fast track to Greece.  A client of mine is from Greece but now lives here and she tells me that Greece is in the shape they are because they are lazy, and nobody wants to work.  Hello, this is what an entitlement society leads to.  Why work for $50,000 when you can get $45,000 in freebies and hand-outs without paying taxes.  This is why the middle class is shrinking.  Because it becomes more and more apealing to live off the dole.  Wake up!  A society cannot sustain socialism.  Intead of complaining about what Mitt wants to cut out I have a suggestion.  Make your own money and take care of yourself so you don't have to worry about goodies and freebies the government might take away.  Buy your own birth control among other things for goodness sake.  The more the government takes from you the more they own you and the more they can take away.

Romney makes it sounds like he Has to go to New Jersey to tour wreckage from the storm.\r\nHe  sounds like he's going  not out of concern, but it will make him look good in the public's\r\neyes. At least Obama seems like someone who truly concerns himself with others and wanting \r\nto help, if and when catastrophes happen or when problems arise. Romney, I believe is only \r\nafter the White House\r\nbecause it's probably the only thing he either hasn't done or that man has a REALLY, REALLY \r\nbig ego.

What a chameleon this guy is.  Now all of a sudden he's the commander in the blue suit.  Didn't hear a thing from him throughout the last three major storms we had, but now all of a suddent he's right there.  For all of his term, he rarely wore a suit, dressed down like some low level apathetic person and spent more time talking about nothing and plopping down on talk show couches.  If he thinks that my opinion of him has changed in any way, he's wrong.  I don't have that short of a memory to not still feel all the negative energy he put into our society so my vote is still for Romney

I think it is important for us to support our voted officials at this time, but, I must say that I have been so troubled by this mans demeanor throughout this whole tragedy . He has used his position to be very impersonal,unprofessional and insensitive at times. This was not the time for him to insult another man and to use this as a political platform. I feel at times like this we really see the character of a man.

In my entire life have never heard nor read of any politician walk back on his words, contradict previous statements he has made, and change his position 180 degrees, even an iota as much as Mitt Romney has over the past decade. Something is very peculiar with Mitt Romney. Does he suffer from a prolonged a stress disorder, an extreme anxiety condition, or something else? His behavior just does not check out. Is he competent enough to hold the highest office in the USA and as Commander in Chief of our nation's armed services?

Romney didn't flip flop on anything. He was asked directly by John King, CNN by the way,  in the primary debate that since FEMA  was not well funded would this type of agency be better handled by\r\nby the states. Romney answered yes and then went on to say it would be even better handled by private enterprise. He is right. The states would be even better equipped if they had FEMA's budget not the federal gov. Mayor Bloomberg this morning told Obama to go to New Jersey we don't need you in the way here. Those states and cities know best how to handle their problems. Get out of the way Obama the country doesn't need to see you in more photo ops.

Huckabee is supposed to be a man of God but he is going against all of the principles of Christianity.

Too ofter the religious right will listen only to those who will tickle their ear with a little antiabortion or homophobic rhetoric; while critisizing the poor as"lacking faith" of "living in sin" as if their poverty was their fault.

I'm sure there were people that used that money to purchase nicer electronics than they had before the storm. And farmers while resourceful shouldn't really talk negatively about government payments

The only "willful" that matters here is that the idiot decided to go and spend his money at the pub so often. It was his decision to put himself in that situation, the owner is not his mother responsible to care for him.

Thanks for setting me straight. I'm really sorry about your cat. I know a lot of people feed "strays" thinking they are strays, even taking them in, never to see their true owner again. I do know of someone, a few decades back, who decided to pick up a cat traveling to his new home in another city!! It is truly sad when you lose a pet, but I'm so happy for you having a great ending. It breaks my hear when I see signs up for "lost dog" or "lost cat."

You know, when a child goes through something this scary and devestating, sometimes it's good for them to have something fun and normal for them to look forward to.  Did it ever occur to anyone that the choice to make sure Halloween trick or treat still happened might be for the benefit of the children and not for the retailers?  Something that might sound trivial to an adult could make all the difference to a child and help take their minds off of all that has happened.

Everything lyin Willardo feeds his braindead followers is a myth. I am sure he would be doing better if he told these repuke dopes that he would create 50 million jobs in the next 4 years. They don't need to be told how. \r\nClueless Lyin Willardo should not even be running for president. But for a lyin moron, talk is cheap. This clueless moron has no idea how to fix anything. This criminal repuke bankupts companies and loses jobs. What a joke. The nuts that follow him actually believe that he is going to create 12 million new jobs and these dopes believe him. He does not have to tell them how, that does not matter. \r\nClueless Lyin Willardo is known as the slapped axx Mexican Mormon Moron for good reason. This complete dunce made himself look even more ignorant than he already is by stating in a campaign clip that if he ever overpaid his taxes, he does not deserve to be your president. Well this repuke dunce overpaid his 2011 taxes by $3,000 to make it look like he was paying a higher tax rate-which he can recover after the election. He has up to 3 years to refile an amended return. Only a pathetic, psychotic, braindead radical right wing cracked teanut dope will vote for him.

Why do people think this about obama responded to quickly? I mean do you need him to tell you when you need to take a crap? People are so dunb in so many areas.All you needed to do is watch tv on the weather station dah!!!!!!!No different when a storm coming.And plus obama didn't think of doing this.His staff did and why????? to make him look good to get a vote.That is why he has people doing his thinking for him.People are so slow upstairs on thinking at times.I did not vote for him 4 years ago and don't plan to vote for him now.He is not a leader nor bush or clinton.People hide behind there mask.Had one who was a drunk and the other was a lube service seeker.And i feel we should have more than 2 people to pick from to be president.Go to wal mart and buy the book on obama.Even his so called wife is nothing which most not.People you better wake up and do it quickly or your going to be sorry.We need to take america back where it use to be in the mid 80's.Give the boot to the aliens and foreigners.That be a good start on getting america back on track.WAKE UP AMERICA.............  ​ ....................  ​ ..............

Diversification of assets is a wonderful thing;  a diversified equities portfolio, fixed income, real estate... for some people, commodities, etc., but life insurance is not an asset class. Buy life insurance if you need the death benefit to protect income or assets. Life insurance is NOT a core investment.  I do recommend life insurance to clients when it is appropriate for their situation.  If someone recommends life insurance as an investment, get another opinion. I am posting this for the benefit of others, I'm not going to try to argue with a life insurance salesman.

I think the moral of the story untold here is: The Ewoks did nothing wrong on Endor. Had the way they lived been played out on Alderon, perhaps another story this would be.

Religion has convinced people that there’s an invisible man…living in the sky, who watches everything you do every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a list of ten specific things he doesn’t want you to do. And if you do any of these things, he will send you to a special place, of burning and fire and smoke and torture and anguish for you to live forever, and suffer and burn and scream until the end of time. But he loves you. He loves you and he needs money.

I don't often post comments to articles like this, but this is a great idea.  All the naysayers and cinematic ideologues will whine and scream, but the connection of these two great names will ensure not only that the Star Wars franchise survives, but thrives.  It also provides George Lucas with the assurance that someone with the same level of committment and focus will take what he has built and strive to make it even greater.  Congratulations to Mr. Lucas and Mr. Iger.  I can't wait to see what they can come up with together.

Even the RBH curator noted that the quote is "often wrongly attributed to Hayes"  It was just a joke. The same people flipping out about this had no problem with Palin's bizarre quotes regarding Paul Revere or Bachmann's citations of the founding slave owners' "tireless" fight to end slavery.    The difference is that those two twits doubled down on their ignorance despite the absence of even a thread of credibility in what they said... whereas Obama's gaffe is a conventional  (and absolutely inconsequential) misreading of history.  There are significant arguments to discredit Obama's first term.  This isn't one of them.

Romney really should keep his mouth shut, because almost every time he opens it, he shows his total ignorance of reality.  I thought that Mormons do not lie, well someone should let Romney remind him of that. I guess he doesn't believe that its Government's duty to help its citizens during major disasters.  We already have the private sector like the Red Cross, Salvation Army, etc., doing their part.\r\n\r\nI feel that Sandy was God's way of saying "Obama is the right choice". God always has a reason why he lets bad things happen to us, maybe its to make us more humble.

the rich like Romney claim they need tax breaks to invest and create jobs for the working class,\r\nRomney claims to have created jobs before and claims he'll do it again,\r\nthe wages clowns like him claim to be good wages for the working class are nothing but insults to the people who possess the drive to serve a purpose in life.\r\n \r\nneither Obama or Romney has a clue, but the lesser of the two evils is Obama,\r\nunless you're a rich clown claiming to be so generous when you only insult the working class with less than what you consider to be pocket change.

Without a gun, yes. A wild boar that size can easily kill a human. Good for the cop. And as bonus, wild boar is delicious! You would think it would taste like ham, and have the same texture, but pleasantly, it is more like a good steak, in taste and texture. With some potatoes, garlic, and a nice gravy, wild boar makes a great dinner. Add some good wine or a nice stout, then and nice chocolate mousse cake with dark chocolate shavings...oh man, now i'm hungry...

After 10 weeks of no electricity or utilities after Katrina, I feel for the people hit by Sandy.\r\nWas kind of thinking with this FEMA talk.  I remember when they were supposed to be getting out the blue tarps to people for their roofs.  I think they were going to have the military or someone distribute them.  But there was some problem with who would pay.  Finally we went down to see if we could just pack one up ourselves as a lot of people did, but FEMA wouldn't release them.  We ended up getting a tarp from a private organization that was helping with their own tarps.  Also, no electricity, no phones, no nothing, and you couldn't get anything done because FEMA would tell you to get with your insurance first, then your insurance when you finally got a visit would send you back to FEMA, then they would send you back to your insurance, then FEMA would have to send things up their chain all the way back to China or somewhere.... it was awful.  People just needed the help released at the local levels.  Just my experience as I remember it.

It is perfectly fine for anyone to voice their concerns, but if you are claiming to be loving Christians, don't turn around and judge others like this. I really don't think people understand that they are just turning those who they are trying to win to God away because all people see is hypocritical, insensitive jerks who think they can say whatever they want because they have a special relationship with God.

Greetings and Happy Halloween from beautiful Chapel Hill, NC. Been having a great time exploring the campus and iconic music venues this town has to offer. Great dining choices, so helpful to a local who knows the town giving you pointers. Tonight it's off to Cam's house and then the Wussy show. Doesn't look like we'll get "Breakfast in Bed" since it was in last night's setlists and is hard for Lisa to sing it on back to back nights. Can't wait to see everyone's costumes, I'm George Harrison Sgt. Pepper era. More to come later including pictures I hope. Stay safe all.

Well said 4Love.....People should help the needy get back on their feet. \r\n  \r\nI am not saying the Federal Government shouldn't get involved with a major disaster but we don't need them most of the time, so why support a permanent bloated federal agency like FEMA that sucks taxpayer dollars year round. \r\n  \r\nWe have many private organizations, the Nation Guard, Churches and mostly private citizens helping their neighbors. \r\n  \r\nI went through a major flood in 1999.....and what I witnessed with FEMA was a major waste of taxpayers money.

My (then) husband was an alcoholic. He went to the bar every night and he had his women. I stayed home and took care of our son. He came home and wrapped himself around the commode every night. He swore he would kill me if I left. (Everybody who knew him believed he would do it) He didn't even stop drinking when he had a stroke (not severe). I finally got up the courage to divorce him after my son was grown. He died drunk and alone and wasn't found for 5 days. Thank God I managed to get up the courage and  sense to divorce the b several years before that happened.  \r\nI was raised in a home where there was no drinking. Heaven only knows how I got myself into that mess but I finally mustered up the courage to get out, even with him ranting and raving that he was going to kill me and our son.  \r\nAnd that folks, is the reason I don't drink and don't go to bars. My son doesn't drink either. He came to hate his father and what he put us through.

I don't understand why Pa. hasn't come out of the dark ages and let the private sector  sell your beer and liquor like almost every other state in the country. Its so nice to go to a liquor store and buy your beer, wine and liquor at a one stop shop, Your local distributors could expand there inventories, your grocery stores could carry these items, There is enough revenue for all to gain and the state could still get its tax dollars.

How odd that you bring up Detroit going bankrupt. Perhaps you don't want to realize that Obama made them file bankruptcy as a prerequisite to the bailout funding. The exact thing Romney suggested. Just like Obama, use someone else's idea and then take credit but, only if it works. Another thing, GM has yet to pay the US back and their stock value has almost tanked. I guess Romney will somehow get blamed for that too. Obama's just about out of "Blame GW Bush" excuses so he's on the lookout for someone new.

They don't claim to solve it in one episode AND it takes place over many weeks - the filming that is Many of the hoarders actually agree to continue with the support and psychological work after their show ends. Many started hoarding after a death of someone close to them or a divorace or some tragedy they just couldn't handle on their own but the  "family" was too self-absorbed to notice until it got too far to go back without help. Then of course the "children" and "siblings" get to come on the tv show and ridicule the poor person who's brain is whacked. Niiiice.  Proves why I detest humans.

It's obvious you are not up to speed on things.. In one of the back stories and in several other places Darth is cloned by the empire and I believe that the emperor is also cloned.. Since they are extremely powerful with the force they can imprint themselves on these clones thus they are back to do what they do best.. This time around Darth reverts back to Anakin to help his son Luke but always has to fight the lure of the dark side.. They also manufacture a bunch of extras that are turned into a powerful bad guy hit squad so there is no easy road to getting rid of evil.. Since Disney is growing up and putting drinking, smoking, violence and sex in their films I believe they will have a more adult theme and there knack for polish will be a plus along with Lucas and company still in the mix.. \r\nIsn't that a $hit, spell check can fix Anakin but Obama always promps for Osama?????

I love Grey's Anatomy, but it is getting old, but I am afraid at what they will replace it with if they stop?  I also loved JAG too. Most of these shows are making the current generation bigger whiners and more shallow and materialistic.

We now see the wisdom of our forefathers in insisting on separation of church and state. \r\nI'm sure they would be very disappointed that their democracy has engendered "Hulkabees" \r\nWhere are the people with the wisdom of our foretathers.... looking at the big picture rather than what's in it for me in the next 2 minutes?

Mormons are not---according to the beliefs and ideas of Christianity---true Christians. If there is a God at all---the spiritual kind or some alien pulling the puppet strings, I hope he keeps people like you far away from me. Just simply because if not, I'd end up killing someone like you because you are so far off base from any truly spiritual person you actually believe your own horse's rear end of a mouth. It is truly sad---not at all respectable or an example of a intelligent religious person.

Carter was the Christian. Reagan rarely stepped foot inside of a church and probably was a closet Catholic but couldn't come out and say it or he would have lost the religious right. Christians: cool. Crazy Christians: uncool!

I see no answer to my question, but I do see a huge lack of understanding on what drives oil prices. Oil prices are determined on a global market, the few drops that ANWR would add to the world pool of oil would have a very little effect on the price of oil, let alone the price of gas. Not embracing keystone has no effect on the price of gas today and arguably little effect in the future. Since you cant answer what Obama has exactly done to drive up the price of gas, maybe you can answer this. When gas was over $4.00 a gallon in 2007 and 2008, what exactly did Bush do drive that price up?

I agree with 'Scottyanon' there are too many channels and very little quality TV.  I've been watching TV since it was a little tiny, tiny screen in a big wooden box and been thrilled over the years about the ingenuity in technology and the quality of the shows presented.  I watched everything.  Now I would rather go shopping and I hate shopping.  And yes, I too would add a lot more shows to the chopping block.  If you stand back and think about it for a while, the majority of TV (and movies for that matter) seem aimed at turning us into mushy mindless drolls.  Maybe it's my independent nature, but I'm not having anyone turn my brain into a marshmellow.  Get up off the sofa and go find other more entertaining, educational, and memory-making things to do with yourself.

I think that's a great idea, since you can always use your contributions for their college fund, if they go, and use your sheltered earnings for your retirement when you reach retirement age. A Roth is always a great way for anything, like an emergency fund or college, etc., since you can always take out what you've put into it, penalty free. You just can't take out the earnings on your investment before your 59 1/2. There are other ways to get some of the earnings out without penalty, before retirement, but I won't get into that for this response.

Mr. Jackson....go talk to Obama and discuss with him that if you want to tax small business as well as take away tax loops for big corporations and levy a higher tax on the rich...they will move their business elsewhere....I can't blame them for that....if I had alot of money and my corporation pays several million already inspite of the tax breaks and now the govt wants my company to pay more well I would do the same thing.  After all it is nothing personal against the govt or the citizens of the US...it is just good business sense to take my money else where of my choosing....but I am only lower middle class and I don't see alot of people who make less than $250,000 hiring anywhere, do you?

I dont understand why the kool-aid drnkers who gush over osama dont know that Huckabee is telling the American people to vote against osama to assure that America remains a Christian nation.  osama is a koran loving islamic terrorist who would destroy the christian way of life that American is founded upon.  These osama sheep will have their throat cuts by their muslim "mesiah".  The dems are so stupid, I am glad they will be eliminated forever after 11/6.  Good riddance fools and you can all sing this song now:  when your brainwashed and you know it clap your hands!

I hope this one time event of Obama caring isn't going to throw off four years of.... - hanging out with Hollywood -  If I had a son "he would look like Teyvon".  - All the campaigning from over a year ago??? - Most divisive President in history - Class warfare president - hate those that hire you WTF??? Spending a "BILLION" dollars to get re-elected, if your a good president?? Who has ever done or needed to do that?? - Super majority first two years in office did nothing but spend and spend, Obama care passed on midnight on Christmas Eve and is over 2,000 pages long - how can this be efficient?? Why all the bribes if it so good?? THIS IS NANCY PELOSI BILL she stated you want to see whats inside pass to found out?? WTF??  Who does this ever?? - NO respect for the CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES - Made some kind of promise to the russians after he wins another term.. \r\n And the list can go on and on but this is just a small part of the highest spending President and most divisive racially and economically this nation has ever seen. Another four years and this nation will not be recognizable, but I will continue to fight for truth and freedom for AMERICA!!!

Amazing how an older woman who speaks her mind can't be given the option to calm down or be escorted out the door until she can maintain herself in a more civil way.

All the rhetoric in your "NEWS" article is so blatantly off base and twisted, I have to wonder about your mental state .

That's the beauty of the Left, they can't stand anyone who disagrees with them or their immoral, twisted views. So with a great big sweep of the pen, they label the "RIGHT" as hate mongering bigots.

republicans consistantly disgust me by using disaster and other terrible situations as political weaponry , obama is doing a fantastic job, if  only the republicans had the maturity to fight this presidency candidacy  politically without resorting to slurs that even the victims relatives were not disgusted by .

Let me start by saying I am Christian to the soul.  It is wrong for other Christians to condemn others, especially, Christians on their beliefs.  The greatest of us who are mature and secure in our Christianity must always show Grace and Mercy.  Prayer will change hearts, not hypocritical rhetoric, which makes the one condemning look as if he or she has no faults or sin, nor do they make mistakes.  We all have fallen short of the Glory of God, and let me be very clear, the only way we are not held accountable for our short comings against God and others is because of Christ . "I require MERCY", said Jesus, and Christians invoking God in our limited wisdom and belief of what we think the Word of God means in worldly matters and expressing it on such a large media stage is very dangerous.  What we should be speaking on these very large stages is Christ and ONLY CHRIST - No Political rhetoric. You can not pick and choose a few things out of the bible and make it a pre-text or sub-text for ones personal political views especially if you are a Christian learned in the Word of God.  If you know the story of Barabbas which was a political extremist against Roman occupancy and rule of Israel, you know the love that Jesus had for Barabbas even though he was wrong and did not understand who Jesus really was and his mission.  Men that profess to know the will of God by expressing such opinionated views on politics will usually find that they are so far away from the knowledge and understanding of God's will they think that other Christians that do not think like them are wrong and on there way to HELL.  They show NO MERCY or LOVE.  They might be surprised they are the ones headed there if they want to invoke scripture based on the Word of God.  Mitt Romney's religion does not even consider themselves to be Christians but Mormons.  The Mormon religion is considered a CULT to any Christians that know the word - "Let them that preach another gospel (which is not the gospel of Christ) be acursed!"  If that is the case then God's Word says, "What does light have to do with darkness?"  Nothing!!!  The Mormon religion is so far off of the Word of God you could say that any Christian that votes for Mitt Romney they are on their way to Hell.  When someone says they are a Christian we can not say that they aren't.  If we see something contrary we might say that they are in error, but not necessarily that they are not Christians.  That error can be corrected, but one who expresses a long life declaration to something that is a little bit harder to change. There are sinners that do not believe in Christ, but do not believe in abortion, or same sex marriage, and there are some who profess Christianity, but think that cheating on their wife is OKAY.  My point is that the government can never pass laws that will govern the heart of men.  That is why the Law of God (the Ten Commandments) could not be lived by men, and we needed Christ to come to perfect and complete the law through himself, bring about Grace in which we now as Christians live by.

"It places the lotion in the basket' LMAO......you are too much!!!

Huckabee is a very sincere and moral person and that is why he is saying this.. On the other hand, Obama is not a Christian .. for anyone who thinks he is.. please know he is not and never has been.. he only throws the word around a few times around election time.. he belongs to a "real" cult that is marxist and racist.. black liberation.  Read the books of James H Cone and you will get a better understanding..  but it is not surprising that he is a marxist as he was brought up surrounded by communists and his best friends and buddies are all communists.  Valerie Jarrett who really runs the white house and her father are long time communists as well as Axelrod , William Ayers, Frank Marshall Davis.. heck.. even obamas grandparents, Mr. & Mrs.Dunham were both communists.. Frank Marshall Davis who was a card carrying Communist was in FBI watch several times in his life .. he wrote articles for the communist newspaper.. he was friends of the Dunhams and he mentored obama from the age of 10 years. Davis .. before he moved to Hawaii actually came from the Chicago pit where he also knew Axelrod and Jarrett.. Open your eyes folks..  you are not looking past the wrapper.. it's time to be smart while we still have a chance..

Mormons call themselves "Christians", but most Christians don't consider the LDS church to be Christian.  Many of us Atheists have been to churches before and some have been raised in a faith, so we do have some first hand experience and a good reason to drop religion altogether.

Well.. in a 2 income household there's still a lot of men who don't bother to come home to do a load a laundry or cook dinner.  My wife's home with the kids now so the bulk falls on her, but when she did work the housework still needed to get done.  She worked 7-3, I worked 8-6.  She had dinner cooked and straightened up, I did the dished and vacuumed.  She did the wash, I put them away.\r\n\r\nNow I work more when she has a rough day.  When you work full time+ you tend to neglect how exhausting chasing a couple little ones can be.  It can be a lot less stressful directing a group of adults.. at least they listen and manage their emotions for the most part.  No chairs or keyboards flying across the room out of frustration.

The “Reverend” Mike Huckster-Be is again proving beyond all doubt that churches, “non-profit” religious organizations and ALL their “representatives” should have ALL of their tax exemptions revoked – retroactively, for about 150 years (that should at least “solve” the “deficit problem”).   \r\n  \r\nAnyone who’d vote on the basis of the intellectual moonshine being distilled and served up by this smarmy, arrogant fraud should forego voting, stay home and pray. \r\n  \r\nAccording to Huck’s scriptures, any true believer who prays to the Lord, can accomplish ANYTHING; therefore, voting seems pointless for a group of people capable of marshalling supernatural forces that can “move mountains” or “create” entire worlds.  \r\n  \r\nSeriously, Christians – stay home and pray, it would be an interesting “test”.

Choice is what God intended. We all have choice. Adam and Eve were given choice. The entire Old Testament had choice! \r\n God sent the Great flood and because he was so harsh, he then sent his Son.\r\nJesus was sent to forgive us our sins in a kinder, gentler way and to remind us that we were given the free will to choose. You people (Ann Romney style), Evangelicals, are once again, getting out of hand. We are to choose.\r\n You, as Christians, are to set an example, as in walk the walk, not talk the( vile) talk. No one wants to be like you and you know you are sinning with this false representation of Christianity!\r\nYou've had this problem since when your religion was in the old west traveling-tent-hucks  ​ ter-revival form. Theatrical Faith Healer Hypocrites with their hands out, scamming and fleecing the naive until, upon being exposed, having to pack up and move onto the next town.\r\nGet thee behind me Satin!!!

No, as we approach upcoming Presidential election it was the PERFECT opportunity for Obama to drum up "brownie points" by appearing to be "in control" and "genuinely caring" to the voting public.  Even better, he didn't have to be "cool", sing, have a White House Brewery beer in his hand, or a teleprompter in his face.

The nation was founded on Biblical principals??? So slavery is a Biblical  principal? And representative democracy is a Biblical principal?? did we stone adulterers, burn witches,  and those who disobeyed their parents as the Bible commands   Like most religious people you pick and choose what you want in the Bible and spout nonsense. The founding fathers were primarily Deists not fundmentalists.  Which of these Biblical precepts were we founded on??ny person who curseth his father or mother must be killed\r\n ~Leviticus 20:9\r\n \r\n If a man has sex with a woman on her period, they are both to be cut off from their people\r\n ~Leviticus 20:18\r\n \r\n People who have flat noses, or are blind or lame, cannot go to an altar of God\r\n ~Leviticus 21:17-18\r\n \r\n Anyone who dreams or prophesizes anything that is against God, or anyone who tries to turn you from God, is to be put to death\r\n ~Deuteronomy 13:5 \r\n (The funny thing about this is that it goes against one of the ten commandments..."thou  ​  shalt not kill")\r\n \r\n The eating of fat is prohibited forever\r\n ~Leviticus 3:17\r\n \r\n  And on and on

Abortion becomes an issue when our tax dollars are used to perform an act many of us are strongly against.   In my opinion it IS NOT a governments job to make moral judgements like this for individuals.    Just like it's not a governments job to pay for such morally charged acts.\r\n \r\nGovernments should stay completely out of such issues including not paying to perform them.   If abortion rights folks feel so strongly about this topic they should start their own. self funded clinics with NO government funding.\r\n \r\nThats how it's supposed to work in a free society.   You can't have it both ways and expect harmony.   Thats the problem with boths sides of this topic.

I originally posted this on September 28, 2012   How prophetic.     Obama has hired the best pollsters available and they have told him that if nothing unforeseen and earth shaking happens he has lost.  You can get all emotional and attack me but the liberal media knows this as well and consequently are using anything imaginable to try and help him. One thing you learn in life as a business person is remain centered.  Critical thinking is your friend!

sadden american - do you listen to yourself when you speak? I am an Independent (support the death penalty, against gay marriage etc) if President Obama has his way my taxes will go up! But after seeing how your party has treated this President solely because of the color of his skin sickens me! As well as how the republicans are the reason why the economy hasn't taken off. They did everything possible to make this President a 1 term President even at the expense of the rest of the American people. I have read 12 studies which all said that the Presidents Jobs Act would have jump started this economy, as well as brought the unemployment rate down to well under 7%. That would have meant, less people on those entitlements that I always hear you talking about, more people working and spending money in my businesses, as well as more people paying taxes thus lowering the deficit! Also, better and safer schools, better and safe bridges and highways as well as more 1st responders and police (maybe those 39 people would be alive today). I am saying this to say I am voting again for this President and I don't think I will ever vote Republican again..Or at least until they get the Tea Party and people like you out of the party! It's a damned shame....Tell Romney that I personally donate $100,000.00 to the charity of his choice if he produces his tax returns (I am not as wealthy as Donald Trump)!

The fact that you had to throw in an ad for Obama in 2012 shows where your priorities lie...

"Air from surrounding areas with higher air pressure pushes in to the low pressure area. Then that "new" air becomes warm and moist and rises, too. As the warm air continues to rise, the surrounding air swirls in to take its place. As the warmed, moist air rises and cools off, the water in the air forms clouds. The whole system of clouds and wind spins and grows, fed by the ocean's heat and water evaporating from the surface."  That is a direct quote from NASA's webpage on how hurricanes form. Just thought you'd like to know.

The only thing that surprised me is that it took that long for him to get knocked out.  His technique is awful.  An experienced fighter would have had his timing after only a couple of strikes and dropped him.\r\n \r\nAs for the harder punch, I'd say it was more the result of a shorter punch with a shorter wind-up landing right on the button.  I've seen much more highly skilled MMA fighters knock fighters much better than this stiff with short range punches because of a very simple biomechanical principal:  that short range punch has the whole body torqued behind it versus a long range punch that is all arm and shoulder.\r\n \r\nIf you want to see how devastating a short range punch properly delivered can be, watch Shane Carwin's KO of Gabe Gonzaga, Brian Stann's KO of Alessio Sakara or Michael Johnson's KO win on the last televised UFC card.  Johnson's KO looks like a nothing punch until you look at the mechanics:  it was short, it was straight, it was right on the button, and the other guy was coming in with his hands down.  It's what you call a force multiplier in motion.

I do find it interesting that he had time for a press conference and photo ops in the situation room.  It was all over the news that Obama was monitoring the storms progress up the coast from the situation room but it was never once mentioned that he was monitoring the Benghazi Terrorist Attack from the situation room.  He won't even say if he was in the situation room during the attack.  He won't even say were he was during the attack.  There were no photo ops and no immediate press conference.  The requests for help from the seals were denied.  Who gave the denial?  Did it come from the situation room?  Those questions will be answered sooner or later.  Someone or multiple someone's need to be prosecuted.

We were very careful what we spent at the time...we were very aware where it came from and did not waste it on Gucci bags or crap like that....\r\n \r\nPS those who donated to Katrina folks,  thank you very much for thinking  about us... I know that there was some bruhaha about where the money went....  But the fact that it was donated by americans from all walks of life is the important thing..  I have come across many folks who did donate and I thank them..  You all were a beacon of hope...  Thank You very very much...

POTUS done too little too late.  ABC reports 10/30/12 early voter results  Romney 52%  Obama  46%  These numbers are pretty close to Gallup & Rasmuessen Polls  daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Tuesday October 30, 2012 shows Mitt Romney attracting support from 49% of voters nationwide, while President Obama earns the vote from 47%. One percent (1%) prefers some other candidate, and two percent (2%) are undecided. This is the fourth consecutive day that Romney has been at the 50% level of support. He has enjoyed a three- or four-point edge on each of those days. No encumbent or challenger has ever lost the election having 50% or more in the polls going into the elections. \r\n  \r\nSwing state tracking: Romney 51% Obama 45%

Yes they were, as a home owner who has attended council meetings, the council member's usually do think they are  important, and make up rule's and regulation's a sthey go along. If you are not part of their clique then you are not welcome, and your opinion does'nt matter.\r\nWe the people do not have any right's anymore, and alot of the law's imposed on us are un-just, and you may not even be aware of them, or think you understand them and your right's only to find out you are sadly mistaken.\r\nIn the state of Wyoming you don't have the right to tell someone repeatedly to get off your property, and when you get close enough to look them directly in the eye and happen to touch their fat stomach in the process they can charge you with battery 17 day's----oh yeah the person asked to leave was a town employee, fully supported by the Albin Town Council. So maybe sometime's it takes longer then three minute's to express yourself, Lord know's politician's NEVER are long winded.

When did Christians stop caring about the poor, hungry and sick?   Romney is going to balance the budget all right, by cutting all programs that help the poor, hungry, sick, old, & uneducated.  Where is the Christian logic in that? We give aid to foreign countries, but giving aid to our own is asking too much!  Go figure!

Hello, fellow Spartan. I think Huckabee is concerned with human life. People who are Christians sometimes seem to vote on economics, but standing up for the innocent should be much more important... Especially when they are being inhumanely killed. Some People aren't very political but just go out and vote without educating themselves.

I agree with this list.  I don't watch any of these shows so get rid of them and put on something that is scripted and creative.  Put some real actors to work not these wannabees looking for their 15 minutes of fame in the boring reality tv world.  I agree the person who said honey boo boo needs to go.  Obnoxious white trash is just that ... trash.  Throw it out!

Leadership!  Its about leadership. 1. Identify the problem. 2 Consider all possible solutions to the problem. 3 Pick the solution that is the most right for the most persons. No solution will ever be right for every person.  he could have kept the celebration date, postponed the celebration date, or cancelled the celebration. He made a thought out leadership decision, not worrying about what people would think.\r\nToo bad more leaders dont display leadership like this.

The frist thing we need to understand is that Trump could if he wants to put I don't think he will. Maybe this will be as this if from the Book Of Matt 19 from God's Word.  A Rich Man Refuses to Follow Jesus \r\n16 A man came to Jesus and asked, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to have eternal life?” \r\n17 Jesus answered, “Why do you ask me about what is good? Only God is good. But if you want to have eternal life, obey the law’s commands.” \r\n18 The man asked, “Which ones?”\r\nJesus answered, “‘You must not murder anyone, you must not commit adultery, you must not steal, you must not tell lies about others, 19 you must respect your father and mother,’[] and ‘love your neighbor[] the same as you love yourself.’[]” \r\n20 The young man said, “I have obeyed all these commands. What else do I need?” \r\n21 Jesus answered, “If you want to be perfect, then go and sell all that you own. Give the money to the poor, and you will have riches in heaven. Then come and follow me!” \r\n22 But when the young man heard Jesus tell him to give away his money, he was sad. He didn’t want to do this, because he was very rich. So he left. \r\n23 Then Jesus said to his followers, “The truth is, it will be very hard for a rich person to enter God’s kingdom. 24 Yes, I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter God’s kingdom.” \r\n25 The followers were amazed to hear this. They asked, “Then who can be saved?” \r\n26 Jesus looked at them and said, “This is something that people cannot do. But God can do anything.” \r\n27 Peter said to him, “We left everything we had and followed you. So what will we have?” Thank You.

The men were as "manufactured" (steroids) but the work in the gym was still necessary.  Personally, I think Arnold, Franco, Lou, Frank Zane, Larry Scott and others look better, but to each his/her own.  As to the women, they looked fit but I've seen some that have juiced to the point where they no longer look like women; went overboard.  But again, whatever floats their boat.  \r\n \r\nIf you've seen recent photos of those from the "classical" period of bodybuilding, you'll see bodies that don't look at all health.  Steroids, better think about the long-term before using them.  If you're good with it and your doctor is good with it, knock yourself out.

Star wars should have only been Star Wars, Return of the Jedi and the Empire Strikes Back!! Too bad we do not have any creative people left in hollywood that could write an original  screen play.

Michael Brown needs to keep his fat mouth shut and go back to judging horses or was it cattle?  Really doesn't matter because what he does and says doesn't matter.  He screwed up big time when Katrina hit and people died because of him screwing up.  No one died because of Obama's lack of attention to this storm.  He was totally on top of it and everyone did their very best to prepare.  Just like everyone will do their very best to help all those adversely affected by Sandy.  Go crawl back under your rock brownie and shut up or roll up your sleeves and start helping out you dumb F--K!

I consider his comments and him to be trashy.  In fact, I consider almost all of them to be trashy.  In my area, a congresswoman is begging on television just before the election.  She says under Barack Obama, the US has borrowed 5 trillion dollars.  I'm sure that is true, but she WAS and IS a CONGRESSWOMAN!  Why has she not spoken up until now???  When she comes to town, I never know until she has left.  Martha won't get my vote!  And this King guy just is the pits.  My plan is to VOTE AGAINST ALL INCUMBENTS.  I hope you will help me and together we can send them home.

They sent an official state of family affairs collection letter but it was returned stating "glass tube broke", and "the turkey baster made a run for it".

Amen & amen Mr. Huckabee. God bless you for your stance on behave of the unborn children. Hopefully, this nation will repent of it's sin and God will once again bless our nation. President Lincoln declared a national day of prayer and repentance to God for our sins. We need that kind of national leader again.

So, now that we know the "best" places for "trick or treating," we'll all hop on planes and rush right out there with our candy bags. Right? But they should have given us more time to book flights. Hurricane Sandy has played havoc with the flight schedules, so getting there is not going to be easy. Oh, well, at least we know where to go now so, next year we can plan ahead. I sometimes wonder, do they actually pay people to write this stuff?
1
Actually, yes. Yes they did. The East Coast has remarkably low unemployment, and a ton of professional jobs.  \r\n  \r\nThis idiot is biting the hand that feeds this damn economy. Of course, he wouldn't know that, out in FARM AID IOWA, would he? \r\n  \r\nNah. \r\n  \r\nP.S. My house has water damage and I'm pretty sure I'm going to have to eat the costs on that one, because my insurance has consistently dodged hurricane damage for every hurricane that's rolled up our way since moving in. \r\n  \r\nI guess I need to get a Gucci bag and bail the rain water out. :P

When you think about how many people will really spend "free" money on crap and unneccesary things rather than on rebuilding their lives or trying to get a little ahead, you don't want to give that money to them. I know I wouldn't. So yes, I think they should have a plan and not waste this very needed money.  Many people do not know how to manage money. They lived their whole life living check to check so, when "free" money or extra money comes into play, they waste it and end up back where they started, with nothing and its nothing to them because this is what their used to.

You all are missing Huckabee's point.  And you honestly think that Obama is a Christian????  Let's start with the Bible's basics like "Thou shalt not kill".  Abortion is murder!  Plain and simple!  I agree with Huckabee.  I'd rather vote for a Mormon who has Christian standards than a man who calls himself a Christian but doesn't care about the life of unborn child and so many other Christian values.  Stop trying to pick people apart (Huckabee, Romney) and really look at what they're saying.

For one thing, Romney has gave a lot of money away to charities, I am hearing 4 million and then some. Read facts! How many millions have O gave out. I hear he collected a few million more over his term. You all keep putting the rich guy down, he is not the richest guy in the world you know. How about all them celebrities, I don't hear to many of them shelling out any money, except when they are on t.v begging for poor people to help. If you would take all of their money and distribute  it out here in America there wouldn't be a lot of children and families living poor in the street today. I could go on, but certain ones are not going to give a crap anyway. If you are going to pick on one person that is rich, then they all need to be brought out.

what an **** if a severe storm is coming my way I would like to have plenty of advance notice so I could plan to get out of town if I had too. He is just playing politics.

Watch out Christians and Catholics. The great satan is lying to you. \r\nThe anti Christ is upon us!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \r\nRepent, all you sinners!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ​ !!!!!!!! \r\nThe Mormon book, The Pearl of Great Price, claims that all other Christian groups are "corrupt" and are an "abomination" in God's sight (Joseph Smith, 2:19). The Mormons deny the Trinity and the existence of a literal burning Hell, yet they promote polytheism (many gods), baptism for the dead, and the notion that Jesus and Satan were originally spirit brothers! \r\nThis is what Todd Akin thinks of lyin Willardo, the Mexican Mormon Moron tax evader, bankrupter, job outsourcer, draft dodger and Etch a Sketch Champion.

In answer to the question of responding too quickly. It is better to prepare and respond during an emergency than to try to get a handle on it while people die and property gets destroyed.

Those who volunteer are to be admired for their 'giving.'  Although many of them do it without the thought of recognition, it is honorable to do so.  But to do so at a big planned production involving 'star' celebrities makes me wonder that there is going to be 'profits' for this whole show.  It just seems that in a perfect world, any/all profits would go to 'charity' and everyone involved in the production would 'volunteer' their time.

Again, we are releasing fossil fuels into the atmosphere at rates that are not anywhere near natural. The fallout of the fuels combined with the containment of our atmosphere leads to an overall warmer climate. That is undeniable...you can see the same effect in any greenhouse. Those gases are a large issue and curbed, we could likely completely halt any effect we have on the planet. But our government refuses to use the technology we have to do just that...letting big oil dictate policies with lobbyists. The hilarious thing is that we export those technologies to other countries who do have laws in place---so if you want to talk about facts, crap comes from both directions.  \r\n The ice caps are melting for much the same reason. Those ice caps are vital to our survival. The light color reflects heat back into the atmosphere while the dark water absorbs the heat...in other words, at some point, the scales will tip and you will no longer have any caps to reflect heat...ocean temps will rise around the world and life as we know it will change. Water levels will rise and and areas like DC will be underwater. But again, this is all fact. Dark colors absorb heat. Light colors reflect heat. Water retains heat better than air...etc. That is why the polar caps are so damn important and why, even if you do not believe in the "the world is ending climate change", should at least open your eyes to the things we are doing that is accelerating the process. Things we frankly. or at least I did, learned in elementary school.

That's similar to how Bank of America got so big. It gave unsecured loans to fire victims during the great SF fire (or was it earthquake?) back in the early 1900's. People felt grateful and stayed with the bank through thick and thin (and there was a LOT of thin).\r\n \r\nExcellent business practice, as well as being helpful to so many displaced people.

I am very familiar with this neighborhood having grown up in Quees. Just as a note,  the majority of people who lived here are firefighters, police and first responders. After 9/11 this neighborhood suffered a greater percentage of loss than any other neighborhood because they are the guardians of New York City. If any one. ANYONE... wishes to feel better about this situation or themselves then bring every building experience you can to help these people rebuild. They will not leave because it is they who protect this great city. They are not rich people but they truly are the Guardians of New York City. It is exactly why this neighborhood was completed evacuated...Thank God. It is because these people have lived through and have seen what an oncoming disaster can do to a beighborhood. At the very least send your prayers to these families.

Meghan is irrelevant but she's right about this. No sane person supports the drug war, from a standpoint of ethics or that of federal economics.  The drug war is designed for the benefit of the agencies that enforce prohibition: Weapons and surveillance manufacturers, industrial food service providers and retailers, the prosecution lobbies and their partner, the industrial/prison complex.   All of these industries see a future where the richest Americans are responsible for a privatized police force, a privatized judicial disputes network (and by "responsible for" what we really mean is "in control of.")  \r\nA pesimistic design for the civil service, judicial and executive branches, the richest of the rich will ensure that competition does not apply to them.  A society of priviledge where half the population is imprisoned to work at Chinese wages to support the economic priviledges of those on the outside of the prison walls.  A condition all of us actually represent with our frivolous lifestyles earned only through our aggression in the world and our leverage on the people of third world economies. \r\n\r\n A society so in fear of losing their freedom that they will obey with 1984-like obedience and internal crisis.

livinghappily, Mormons call themselves Christians but they follow a different Christ than Christians. The Christ of the Christians was God in the flesh. The creator.  The Christ of the Mormons is a created being. The brother of Satan. That's a huge difference. They follow a Christ of their own creation. One revealed by Joseph Smith, the Book of Mormon and Doctrines and Covenants.  Not the Christ revealed in the Bible. Seems like you're the one misinformed. That's great that they have "high standards" and a "work ethic" but that won't get them into Heaven. They think their own righteousness and good works will get them into Heaven. Not the righteousness of Christ that is given to us by grace. Mormonism couldn't be further from true Christianity. The only similarity is that they claim to follow Jesus. It's just a false Jesus. Not the real one.

There are only so many notes in music. There are tons of songs that have similar hooks and melodies that same very similar to other songs. That doesn't mean that the two songs are the same or were ripped off. I can think of several songs that had that happen and no one sued anyone or if they tried they lost. If her song didn't make it in 2010 and now wants to make money off of another person or group who managed to get a hit, well that's just too bad. These things happen but unless she can prove that Carly and her group knew and purposedly used her song or parts of it she has no case.

Great...just another example of Hollywood running out of new ideas, so they have to thrash the old ones, do stupid remakes, and generally run everything into the ground. This proves that they don't have any talent when it comes to writing, most ideas are done, old, and stale, and there really never was a reason to objectify and worship these people in the first place. Millions and billions of dollars have been wasted on a select few people. Those people then turn and politicize themselves into attention whores who then LOSE the respect they gained from mediocre performing.\r\n\r\nI'm more of a Star Trek fan myself, but I hate to see anything decent destroyed.

I am very proud of President Obama.  I feel he is doing a good job  seeing to the needs of the ravaged storm victims. This man is dammed if he does and he's dammed if he don't.\r\n \r\n He has been right here at home and setting up aid every time a disaster was coming.  Why don't you run for president,  Brownie  and get your name and your family dragged through the media  and have your heritage questioned. Leave him to his job and go tend to yours.  If you don't have enough to do go serve some hot meals to your fellow citizens in need!

So... this was a "brothel" where all the girls & boys were there of their own free will... BuIIshit!  It's slave trade!\r\nKeep investigating & you'll find there's a lot more of this & worse going on in the Vatican.  I'm more surprised that this was reported than the fact that it happens.  You know good & well the Catholics want to keep their dirty little secrets & they have the money & power to silence many victims.  Considering that we are talking about Russia, they need to perform thorough investigation & start looking for buried bodies; not some 1/2 assed deposition of a bunch of liars & pedophiles.

.It could be better if FEMA is restructured & reorganized under an ex-Army General from Engineers with staffing from all states with periodic training centrally but deployment in states to be near the disaster points. In the event of bigger disaster all teams of states could be joined to handle centrally rather than individually. Romney opinion to give responsibility to states will again involve contractors like defense services, profits not philanthropic role expected of them. In fact states could do better but politics & vested interests do not allow its better performance. FEMA is under evolution and development, as an experiment could be tried in more vulnerable state with Republican governance to build a model for other states unlike Romney who never offered to other states during his Governorship of Massachusetts as he professes.

Some people think they have the right to judge President Obama and determine his faith for him (Flatlander?). And they usually do it with such class!  Well I guess if Romney can accuse & judge 47% of Americans, his supporters must be qualified to do the same to anyone they choose.  In regards to Huckabee, maybe he should pay closer attention to what God will hold him personally accountable for. Neither political party is the Kingdom of God if Huckabee hasn't noticed. And Mitt Romney is not a Christian for sure. He admits that he's Mormon. Obama claims he is a Christian. God will be the judge of that as He will with each & every one who's been given the choice.

No, the banks weren't all going under themselves.  There was, and still is, enormous amounts of money at the sidelines that could have been used to manage this process as it has been done with countless organizations in the past.  The insurance companies holding the paper on bad mortgages were toast, but that is a different story.   You missed the point, however:\r\n \r\n "Romney wanted to let Detroit go bankrupt."  True statement. \r\n "Obama DID let Detroit go bankrupt."  Also a true statement. \r\n Why, then, do democrats keep using the Romney statement as if it is a bad thing since their own leader of choice did the same thing?

The MSN question is not, "did climate change cause Sandy," but "is it behind super-storms LIKE Sandy."  I'm not sure what we have to compare it to, other than Sandy.\r\n\r\n1. Scientific American is not a peer-reviewed scientific journal.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, they are vastly better on science topics than most news sources and I'm not dogging them, but it's important to point this out.\r\n\r\n2.  This is a blog article that was not published in the magazine.  You can read it at:\r\nhttp://blogs.scienti  ​ ficamerican.com/obse  ​ rvations/2012/10/30/  ​ did-climate-change-c  ​ ause-hurricane-sandy  ​ /\r\n(or click on the link called [Source] at the end of the MSN article.)\r\n\r\n3.  The author, Mark Fischetti has a physics degree, but is not a climate scientist.\r\n\r\n4.  That said, climate science is Fischetti's beat and he predicted back in 2001 (4 years before Katrina) what could happen if a big one hit New Orleans.\r\n\r\n5.  At first blush, his summary of the essential facts regarding the link between AGW and severe weather events is spot on.  It's easy to support or deny it without knowing what he said, if you're not interested in the facts.

This is what I Think, \r\n This is what they are doing now.  You can't mention anything about race because their quick response is to say  "you are playing the race card" \r\n Let me tell you Jews always talk about the Holocaust all the time.  They will never forget it and they will let others know about it. \r\n Blacks are the only group that got F##cked up the @ss with no vaseline and then are told not to talk about it. \r\n I won't go there with the American Natives, it's too obvious to me.

Does anyone else remember a while back when she went on that ridiculous 'celebrity' dating show, (called 'Celebridate', I think) where her date had a glass of wine with his supper (no doubt in an effort to just get through the thing with his sanity intact), and she harped on and on, and on and on, and on and on (ad infinitum) about clean living and sobriety and how even one sip of alcohol was 'self medicating'?\r\n \r\nYeah... f#$%!ng hypocrite!

There have been numerous times in church history where the church was on the wrong side of right.  From the crusades, to slavery and eugenics and the holocaust.   For Huckabee to make such a statement defies history.   This is nothing more than politico-religious fear mongering and it has no basis in truth.

Detroit has been failing for a long time. Our Republican Governor hasn't helped it at all, but he did help himself to a $300 MILLION fund that belonged to Detroit and spent a lot of it on mudslinging ads meant to discredit the owner of the Ambassador Bridge so his new bridge project could get built. IF he got his bridge, WE would get more expensive border crossings and fees that aren't taxes... wink wink. Never trust Republicans.

@happy_buddy, why don't you tell the truth? He slammed the mayor of Atlantic City for ignoring evacuation orders. The mayor of AC told his people to stay and that they had setup safe shelters for them. Those safe shelters were 2 blocks from the ocean and flooded and all the people had to be rescued by boat. He deserved to be slammed, he put all of the people in his town at risk for a stupid reason.

I think this show could still make it if they just stopped and took it in the right direction. They need to get rid of alan's girlfriend who i think is just a gross character and is bringing the show down. They also need to keep walden as a rich "single" playboy. And finally get alan back some sort of life. he owns a business as a chiropractor for crying out loud, they do make good money. Find funny things that don't require him being a total idiot. It has gotten way to old. I wish the writers would read this and maybe they would stand a chance.

How can any braindead, pathetic radical right wing cracked teanut dunce vote for this guy. \r\nThe repukes also want to ban invitro fertilization. Yet 3 of Willardo's children had this done to produce children. Now, he wants to outlaw it to get the votes of the evangelical crazies. He will lie and do anything to win. Then the evangelicals will probably get screwed if he is elected. His campaign manager called him an Etch a Sketch player. When he is elected you can't hold him to anything he promised. \r\nHis true allegiance is to the criminal corporate masters who are bankrolling his campaign so they get regulations eased to enable them to rob and steal from us once again as was done under Bush Bin Lyin and his criminal gang led by President Cheney.

@ goat b.\r\n \r\nAndrew came ashore as a Cat 5, with a lower pressure (922 mb vs 940 mb for Sandy) and much higher winds -- 165mph, so in both those respects, it was much stronger. But it was also much smaller. Just 90 miles for the eye, the winds were 35 mph. Sandy was 1000 miles across when it came ashore. That is a really, really BIG baby.\r\n \r\nHugo was 944 mb and 140 mph sustained when it came ashore as a Cat 4 in Charlseton.\r\n \r\nSandy was a Cat 1 - least strong of the three. But small? When you count the number of people whose lives and property were directly impacted by the storm, Sandy is the most destructive. Seriously.

After events like this small insurance companies go out of business leaving customers screwed as well as it takes a long time to get the money because of so many claims.  City budgets don't have the money to repair public works that are destroyed etc.  So in the time between getting you insurance settlement when your house is wiped off the map it is awesome to have a roof over your head.  This is not a political thing it is a humanitarian thing.  Republicans and democrats living there need help.  How do people not know this stuff?  "If you build your house on a river..." REALLY?

Wow, since when did the Huckster earn the right to  say that if a Christian votes for the wrong person they will suffer the fires of Hell?

And, by the way, in the Bible it says, "Judge not, lest you be judged." Isn't that what they are doing? Judging someone for the way they vote? Burns my britches!!!!

King is right.  There will be many abuses when the victims receive money to live on.  Most will do the right thing and pay for food, shelter, and heat for their families.  There will be many that blow the money on beer and tattoos too.  What he said and how he said it wasn't very PC.  Speaking of PC, pres Obama promises a ride to the poll and a PC for anyone in the disaster areas that vote for him.

No! sour grapes for Brownie. To bad Brownie was in LA with  Bush reading about the duck and not taking Katrina serious. What does Benghazi have to do with his statement? Just cannot remember how many troop died under Bush/his father' , plus their administration and not to mention the after mass of the vets who returned home medically disabled. The solution for Brownie/Bush is to take care of the needs of all vets and their families plus their children on a daily basis perhaps they  want be trying to get political points. By the way, that includes victims from Katina/Sandy. God will continue to Bless Obama sure he (God)  is sick/tired of this white/black issue. Black people certainly did not wake up doing delivery or as they grew wearing a sign wanting to be black. They deserve every opportunity as white people. Glad white/black will be a situation of the pass in the near future, it will not only be Obama who is mixed, just think about the pure mexican or some one as the governor of La. I do believe the conversation will be "boy do you remember our pass. Brownie what's in this for you, a job well so do many of us who are unemployed.

There is no comparison here that will stand up under scrutiny. Mr. Obama said for days after the attack that it was related to the recent 'film' that caused so much trouble. We now know that he knew otherwise.\r\n \r\nAs to Mr. Huckabee, any governor, in making a pardon decision, relies on the information given him by counselors, probation officers, et al , in making that decision. The person in question here obviously either made enough progress  or faked it good enough for a recommendation to be made on his behalf. The fact, therefore, that he screwed it up is HIS fault, and HIS alone. Mr. Huckabee shares no blame at all. Mr. Obama, on the other hand, must bear ALL the blame. He tried to fake it and got caught red handed. Wre shall now see whether the voters will hold him accountable...just another voice...

And down, down we go!! The stock market follows the economy. Since the economy is a mess (thanks Barry), the stock market will follow with a downward path of it's own. Do you really think that this country can carry unpayable, crushing debt without the economy hitting the skids?? If you think so ... then you are as economically as dumb as Obama!! If you go back to the siuations in Greece and Spain, there is an incredibly similar scenario that went on. Just follow the trends and you'll see that the U.S. is right in the same path as those countries just a year or two behing them. There is no way that we can pay off the debt that Obama has run up. We are like a family suffering from too many bills and not enough money to pay them!! Good going Barry.

I probably should reconsider FEMA, but I thought the Obama Administration, was going to shake it up after the Fiasco in New Orleans...Katrina.\r\n \r\nMaybe it needs,some cuts....BUT FIRST, I would like to see any/all elimination of Fraud...\r\nThat can be 10-15% or more of the budget itself.\r\n \r\nMuch like Soc.

Don't much care for the guy making the comment I do think his point was that the biggest reason Obama has appeared to be on top of things is pretty much because of his complete and total bungling of Bengazi-gate and his and Bidens ridiculous response to the father of one of the our Americans murdered. Obama coudn't look that father straight in the eyes and give any kind of true and sincere condolences and he couldn't reign in that big mouth moron Biden from so rudely asking that same father "did your son always have balls the size of cueballs"?. He know  he screwed the pooch with his "VIDEO lies", and has NO choice but to show up during this storm if he doesn't want to totally blow any chance he might have of winning the election  I'm sure he'd rather run off to Vegas if he could get away with it!!!! And before any of you bitch, this is my opinion, don't care about your response, and am a Independent voter, not repub or dem!!!

The only thing that's a shame about the ad is that Huckabee himself is not running for President! You watch!  The "religious Christians" will put Romney in office.  Not because of his religious affiliation, but because of the things he stands for.  He is about building America up and he's proud to be an American unlike what's in the White House now.  Yes I believe Christians will incur the wrath of God if they do not vote and vote right!  Amen Huckabee!

Perhaps the congressman should really look at the pictures of the devastation and people who lost their houses in the fire. Winter is coming, I'm sure those affected by Sandy would much rather be in their homes with the basic essentials (shelther, heat, electricity, food, warm clothing) than running to the store to blow money. Open your eyes Congressman, you making assumptions based on the what a small percentage did during Hurricane Katrina. Shame on you Congressman for focusing on the the exception. My heart goes out to all of those affected by this horrible storm and its aftermath. May God Bless you and your families as you face rebuilding your lives and communities.

The problem with lyin Willardo is what he owes the government in taxes that he has evaded. He has yet to report one full year of any federal tax return. Once the government found out that he has hidden accounts overseas, he did not release his 2011 returns as it was not reported in there. His accountants are working on it now. When he does release, the last 5 years, he may be arrested for tax evasion. \r\nThe only reason people open overseas numbered bank accounts is to evade taxes on unreported income. It is estmated by some, that lyin Willardo, the Mexican Mormon Moron tax evader, bankrupter, draft dodger, job outsourcer and Etch a Sketch champion has hidden about 32 million in numbered accounts in the Cayman Islands and Switzerland. Unnamed workers at these banks sent this info to the IRS.  \r\nHopefully, they will arrest this right wing criminal tax evader before the election. \r\nThis is why he won't release the last 5 years of his tax returns. \r\nI wonder if that is where he keeps his Mexican birth certficate also \r\nEven totally braindead repuke fruitcakes have to admit that lyin Willardo would be suing Reid if the allegations were not true and showing his tax returns to prove it. He can't, because it is true. Reid really wants the lyin'Mexican Mormon Moron to sue him, so he will have to open up his tax records to the public. Brilliant move. Then off to jail for lyin Willardo. Hopefully, they will send this tax evading criminal back to jail in his birthplace in Tijuana. We don't want to pay for his jail expense here.

Where is hate, where is bigotry, where is racism, in his remarks?? I don't agree God will judge you for this vote but don't see your rants either! If he believes God will judge us he can say that, pull out the facts and not resort to name calling! Weakens your view when useless name calling is used.

You have to realize one thing about the liquor control in the Victorian State of Pennsylvania. The PLCB (Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board) is like a spin off of the Gestapo division in the war. FIRST, they are a Union and control a lot of say so in the state. As anyone knows who comes from outside the state and gets to try to purchase liquor. BUT SOON they will be busted and the liquor stores will be PRIVATIZED!!!

Someone pretty, pretty please get word to the right person to make a storyline for a  tv series, cable or even a miniseries with "The Lost Tribe of the Sith". I think we need to see more of what its like on the "Darth" side of the Star Wars Universe. It would be cheap and easy to make... just pick any exotic location since they are stranded on a planet. Teaming with HBO or Showtime would be excellent for those of us who would like to see more mature orientated material since now the first generation are around our 40's and 50's. I love star wars.... .but face it.... sith are bad.... and how would you tame down a bunch of self serving, back stabbing, conniving crew of Sith with nothing else better to do stranded on a planet.

The Red Cross accepts monetary donations only.  They simply are not set up to house and store donated supplies and food items.  There are other agencies set up to handle those sorts of items.  The Red Cross is in NEED of monetary donations to assist in this massive response.  Every dollar donated to the Red Cross for Disaster Relief is available IMMEDIATELY.  Donations can be made by calling 1-800-Red Cross, their web site...  or by texting REDCROSS to 90999 to make a $10 donation to the Disaster Relief Fund.

When I had my Father Buried , It was like a sealed  Box, from the funeral home, It was made of I felt like paper Could not tell you but it was solid, he was placed in a concrete vault. Like everyone else and the most Beautiful Taps was play'd , I had no Money's and lot's of worries as I his daughter sat there alone, So If any one cares you are all welcome to go to Funeral's.  Everyday they have to bury' ones with out Family together at Willamette National it is around 3pm.. The  Cemeteries aren't Funeral  homes which does the casket.. I at least had them wash his feet for Heaven..

This is similar to what I struggle with....I think it might be worth opening a Roth account over 50 if you're trying to shelter more money from taxes. I have contributed the maximum to my 401K for quite a few years but figure that I will only contribute to a Roth if I want to shelter some additional growth, interest or dividends on investments. If you have cash to survive on and a substantial 401K for retirement....after 50+, I figure a Roth is just another tax shelter, but almost not worth it, if you have been a good saver. The limit is only $6,000/yr for over 50. \r\nDepending on what you already have saved up for retirement at that time, it may seem very minimal to add a Roth account. If you earn 7% of $6,000, you will save the taxes on $42 dollars a year...seems like it may or may not be worth, depening on your situation. If I were to contribute more to the Roth I have, I would place my more risky and potential high growth investments in it because of the tax shelter.

The ad is appaling and yet revealing.  It has taken some fundamental  branches of Chrisendom over 2000 years of mis-representing Jesus to succumb to the self inflicted drugs of hatred and fear as seems to be the root cause of Mike Huckabee's delusional ranting and raving.  Just look at his picture on the cover of this ad. Did you ever see a more fitting mask for hatred? I realize it is hallloween but , even so, It seems so easy for fundamentalists of any religion or political party to consign all those  of a different perspective to the nether regions.  Such behavior may be called ignorance on the part of those who have never had access to a different interpretation of their religious books.  Unfortunately, according to Jesus, those who confuse the works of God, as Mike Huckabee, seems to have done is not the result of ignorance. He is supposed to be educated.  More likely akin to the unpardonable sin and simple stupidity which seems to overcome those who sip on such poison of hatred and fear until they join all religoius jihadists \r\nunder the slogan..."My way or the highway"

When we were kids, we often accompanied the adults to the cemetery for the tending of graves. being kids, we would run around and play. We were warned NOT to step on the graves. Being kids, we didn't listen. We didn't care. Who were we going to bother?  Eventually we found out. While running and playing tag, my brother's foot suddenly sank into the sandy soil. This was before concrete vaults were required in cemeteries. Apparently the grave "settled", meaning we broke the coffin lid beneath and the earth collapsed in. To be expected, but freaky nonetheless.

Of all the outright LIES they have told and the FLIP FLOPPING of issue after issue, how can ANYONE vote for them ?? I'd vote for a moderate Republican if he had good ideas, and stood for something, but these guys are just a couple of total idiots that think the amercan people need someone to "save" them from Obama. What do we need saving from ?? Unemployment has gone down from 9.3% in 2009, to 7.8% now. Housing values and starts are UP. GDP was -2.3% in 2009, now it's 1% positive. Budget deficit was 1.4 trillion (budget already passed when he came into office), now it's slightly over 1 trillion, a 400 BILLION gain. Stock market was about 7,300 in 2009, now it's over 13,000. What more proof do you need that we are moving in the right direction ??

This girl is likely mentally ill.  What sane person would set themself on fire?  How do you know she was even thinking clearly enough to make a rational decision about what she did?  Just because she was able to paint three letters on a car and strike a fire to light herself and then accuse the KKK does not mean she was not mentally ill or irrational at the time.  Even people who are psychotic can make plans and carry them out-they just might be based on delusions or affected and maybe even caused by hallucinations.  I'm not saying this girl was psychotic, just using that as an example-that even someone that ill is capable of making plans.  Would you blame a sick person for being sick?\r\n \r\nMaybe she is the terrible person people are making her out to be, but maybe she is really mentally ill.

As far as marriage, this is another issue where people can have different views without legislating those views.\r\n \r\nI would like someone to explain how the same people who talk about the "institution of marriage" being threatened can also talk about how marriage is between one man and one woman.  Which one is it - one and one, or some big institution?\r\n \r\nI am married, have been for 17 years, and that is not going to change if other people are allowed to make their own decisions like responsible adults.  It's not about whether or not same-sex couples should marry - it's about people having the freedom to make their own decisions in matters that affect nobody else.

This election is now truly up in the air.  With a lot of voters in the post storm states facing the decision of trying to find a voting station, or cleaning up the mess from the storm / job / bills, who knows how many voters will actually vote compared to those who have more important matters to attend to. Voting isn't usually a priority when other things need their attention. Should be interesting and expecting a lower turnout.

Say what you will about FEMA but before you do so please read my post:\r\n\r\nIn Louisiana during last hurricane, FEMA rolled into New Orleans and guess what happened:\r\nl.  We could not get any food stamp assistance because our income level was too much for \r\n     $200.00 payment as there were income levels to be addressed to get the stamps.  If you \r\n       were on welfare it was automatically posted to your existing account.\r\n2. No insurance coverage automatic FEMA help.  No flood insurance automatic FEMA help.\r\n 3.  A low interest SBA loan was available to anyone else who  filed and was available after\r\n       insurance paid balance.\r\n\r\nTo finalize my thoughts, the hurricane only hit and flooded low income and welfare people\r\nand to _____ with anyone else.  Class warfare at its best.  My opiinion, it needs to go.

Romney was asked 14 times while showing off that he can load a truck and did not answer one time \r\nany of the Questions citizens were throwing at him.   He completely ignored them.  It makes me sick \r\nto see people supporting him.   Did you ever try to have a civil conversation with a Republican....You \r\nare wasting your time.   They won't listen, they keep interrupting you and say Obama is a Muslim, a liar a socialist, \r\netc.  He is a Christian.  They can't carry on a discussion on both parties.  They won't admit the good that Obama has done.We \r\nwere on a   brink of a depression in 2008.  The Stock Market Fell to the low 8.000pt.'s.  I lost alot \r\nof money that year.   Both in investment's and 401K's.  Today the Stock Market is  13,000 pt's. \r\nDoesn't this show something.  I do not trust Romney.......Too many contradictions.  He may be a businessman, \r\nbut he is not Presidential material.

This guy is a tool no doubt and shouldn't even have let it get that far, and seriously you can't tell whether a baby is gonna be cute or not until they're about 9 months old when there features take on some definition. But on one hand I can almost understand why he did it. Humans mate based on certain physiological aspects that most of the time they aren't even aware of, facial symmetry, wider hips on women versus narrow (thus ensuring safe delivery), eye shape (larger versus smaller) etc. Then couple that with China's one child law, and he was in fact defrauded and pissed off that what he signed up for was definitely not what he got. So he wants a divorce so he can remarry and probably have another kid, and since he already has one, he has to pay the government a fee of around 120K for the right to do so, the exact amount he was awarded by the judge, also if he wins the case the kid gets classified as physically unacceptable, couple that with her being a girl and his chances of being approved to have a second child just tripled. So yeah, he's actually even more of a douche because the lawsuit was obviously very calculated.

Stop using the same old rhetoric, it shows your lack of intelligence, conviction and blatant ignorance of current events. You need to stop chasing a ghost who doesn't exist any longer. Yes, GWB screwed up, but your buddy Oduma has made it even worse for the next 2-3 generations after that with $8 trillion in new debt and with other countless fiscal and monetary miscues and messes. He took a bad problem and made it worse.

Oh-collect monies to pay their staff-got that already.  \r\nWe need to take a good hard look at what FEMA actually does ! Can it be combined or phased in with the National Guard/ Red Cross efforts ?  It seems that the National Guard personnel are much more qualified to respond to national disasters than FEMA .

Wow.  On the previous version of this story I had mentioned that the men who had done this should be tied to poles and burned alive.  To the men who did not do this, I am sorry.  This is one racist bitch who has taken hate to a whole new level.  After they get all the skin graphs put on and let her heal up,  SHE needs to put on trial for a hate crime against white men.  That will never happen even though it should.

What a Bozo...this guy is a joke...but coming from the 3-ring circus of the George "W" fiasco maybe I can understand. He and his inept boss George W Bush were the worst administration this country has ever had. We are still paying for their mistakes and to think that it could be corrected in 4 years is crazy.

This is crazy.  When someone speaks of fiscal responsibility and making the Federal government more cost effective, the spin makes it sound like he is going to slash all Federal moneys for disasters.  Not true.  The point is the money would be better spent by local rather that Federal groups.  That is what he said, not what the spin doctors said he said.  Shame on MSN.

the christian doctrine that jesus set down for us has been turned into something dispicable, ugly, violent and hatefilled. "love thy neighbor as thyself." "do not judge lest ye be judged.' the story of the good samaritan. your brainwashing of the christian doctrine, something wholly concocted by men for the glory of men and the obsession of power has you thinking things that just are not true. god is not a man, he never was a man. it says right there in the bible. god is not a christian, jesus wasn't a christian. he was a hebrew. he taught that you didn't need a church to be saved, to be one with god. why? because it is your spirit, that part of you that is different than everyone else who ever lived that is part of god, the power and consciousness of the universe. god couldn't care less who you vote for. that is just stupid. and before you go judging someone for having an abortion or being gay, maybe you should take a walk in their shoes. you have no idea what is going on in their hearts? and you have no right to judge them. Jesus said that. if you vote against someone because they support a woman's right to choose what she does with her body, that YOUR prejudice speaking, don't drag God into. His existence is way too big to be concerned by your petty hatred

There is no Christian candidate this presidential election ; however , there are issues that are relevant to Christian voters . I believe that's where Huckabee is coming from . We can't vote for a candidate that is pro gay marriage . Abortion is wrong  .  Obama's pandering to Muslims and his disdane for Israel is unacceptable for Christians . \r\nThese issues maybe acceptable for non-Christians and you will vote as your concious dictates . If you are a person of no faith go ahead and do what you want . It doesn't matter . For many of you life sucks and then you die . \r\nHuckabee is right if you are a Christian and following in Jesus' footsteps . He is a right wing religous zealot if you are anything but Christian . As for me and my family we will follow the Lord .
1
Actually - Everything he said is false.  America was founded for a single reason - religious FREEDOM.  The founders left a government who put God in everything and made all laws based on "holy wisdom".  The pilgrims were Christians but they did not want their civil rights governed by the church.  Separation of Chruch and State is a guiding principle of America and the Constitution.  No religion is persecuted in America because no religion is allowed to run the country.   So the "Godly roots" you mention do not exist now and never did.\r\n \r\nSecond, most right-wing Christians would agree with Huckabee's comment if they thought it through.  He said, "right to life from conception through natural death."  Natural death means no death penalty for criminals.  It also opens the door for much, much stricter gun control.\r\n \r\nThird, I don't think most right-wing Christians are thoroughly familiar with Mormon theology.  The concepts are unrecognizable to most Christians except for some key words like "God".\r\n \r\nSo if you're trying to vote in a theocracy, Romney still isn't your candidate.  And Ryan's own religion has disavowed his political stance (American Council of Bishops and certain orders of nuns and priests).

30yrs? You are partly correct. Fish are a food, for now: " (Simba) Think deeeper!" as Mufasa (his Daddy) said.  Realize with profound wisdom: In the great vision of a new sky and a new earth, our current historical age "places us" as 'living in the tail end of the second Angelic "woe!" of a 2,000 year old Revelation dream' still not wrong and is still continuing full speed ahead. That third "Woe" is coming fast! Trust me, you do not want to be here for it. You may not have 30yrs left. PETA means nothing more than a worldly distraction.  Be ready to be secure and endure. You can curse at me now or later, or... "Investigate on your own. You can thank me later :)"   Check this wisdom out --->  [There is a better '.org' anization called 'amazingdiscoveries'  ​  in your search engine: Professor Veith is so far verifiably '(mark-on)correct'.]  ​  A series called 'On Slaught.'

Nope seen it many times here in New Orleans, now you all know how it feels to be left with nothing after a hurricane maybe now all you northeners won 't say "well you shouldnt live there, move if you dont want to flood" and things like that. That is what we were hearing after Katrina which was a cat 5 not the 1 you all had, i fell for you and am sorry this happened but maybe people wont be so rude and tell us to not live here next time a storm hits. Also at least you are getting help from all over, we DIDNT after katrina for days.

The birther issue can now be best settled with a win for both sides.  Obama was actually born a US citizen.  He then went as a small child to Indonesia and in order to be educated in Public Schools did indeed have his mother give up his citizenship to gain a public education in Indonesia. It is the law there that he needed to be an Indonesian and we should understand it was not his decision.  He was forever left with the dilemma of where and who he should swear his allegiance to.  Many immigrants have faced a similar decision. He was then faced with an additional quandry when applying to Occidental University.   He applied as an Indonesian exchange student and applied for admittance as a foriegn student in need of financial aid.   Yes he did lie and yes there are issues of his citizenship but not birth place.  But to defend him I think he was dealt a hand he had little control over and this has raised character issues ever since.  I think his lifelong choice of secrecy and dishonesty were learned during  these times of concern and have been somewhat of an achilles for him ever since.  His was in an instance where the truth would have denied him an American life and future.  He should at some point give us all the respect we as fellow citizens deserve and tell it  like it is.  I don't believe he has the character to ever do this however,  and thus the constant feeling of being suspect many of us share and will probably haunt him his whole life.

I dont believe life starts at conception, ..maybe 3 or 4 months down the line but at conception it's nothing more than a few cells duplicating itself, no consience or feelings at that point. Thank my lucky stars abortion was legal in the 80's otherwise I would have had 10 kids before I got out of High School, and you know how good a 17 year old can raise a kid..right ?\r\n \r\nGive us all a break you crazy Christians and stop pushing your Bull Crap views on the rest of us !

Stop with the Disney hating.  Apparantly none of you read all of this article.  Disney bought LucasFilm, but they are not dismantling it.  Meaning the same production group that made the last films will likely play a part in making the new ones.  I don't expect Disney to turn this franchise over to Pixar or the folks who made John Carter.  Relax, and be happy that you will be able to see some more Star Wars films before you die... and take your kids, they will love it.

Wrong, Wrong and Wrong. Huckabee forgets Grace in his equation and it is doubtful that our votes are recorded in heaven. The video was fine until he made the comment that your vote will be recorded in eternity. He comes from the ilk that believes that you life will be played before you and you will be judged by your works. I personally believe in Jesus Christ and will be judged through the filter of Christ blood that was shed for me and I will be rewarded for my "good works". God cares about your heart. In a society that teaches from a human secular point of view is it any wonder that people are misguided? What sin is the unpardonable sin? Did not Christ die for all sin? Is ignorance of an issue a sin? I am sorry; people are too quick to judge. Why worry about the splinter in my eye when you have a plank in yours? I have major issues with Barrack Obama and will not be voting for him. But I don't believe any one person is going to hell because they misguidedly vote for Obama.

These are all poll averages. Out of the 11 "toss up" states, Obama is leading in seven of them, Romney is leading in three of them and one is currently tied. Romney is leading in Virginia( .5)  and  Florida (1.3) But both states have been trending back towards Obama over the last week.

Check the records, azzhat. Obama laid a wreath at the Unknown Soldier Tomb on Memorial Day 2009,  2011 and 2012.  He gave his Memorial Day speech at Andrews AFB in 2010.  It's okay to hate the guy but don't freakin' make up stories to pass your vitriol.  Oh, and for the freakin' record, Geo W Bush was in France in 2002 and didn't make the Memorial Day Ceremony, Geo H W Bush NEVER visited Arlington on Memorial Day and even vacationed 2 of those Memorial Day weeks in Kennebunkport, Ronald Reagan missed 4 of 8 Memorial Days at Arlington, Clinton made all 8 visits to Arlington on Memorial.  Check Snopes for accuracy, azzhat.

I can't and won't speak for Mike but I do know that Obama may claim to be a Christian but there is not evidence of this from the fruit of his labor. He supports abortion when the Bible is clear that life begins at conception.  Obama supports same sex marriage and tries to support his position by quoting the Bible. Referencing that we are to love our neighbor. Well if you love someone you try to protect them from harm not encourage them. In other words if I love my neighbor then I would not let them walk out in front of a bus without trying to stop them. If you love someone you would try to stop them from drinking and driving, you don't change the law to allow them to drink and drive.

What I'm saying is that PETA is 100% hypocritical for placing the value of a fish's life above that of a human baby murdered by its physician in the womb of its mother... the one place where it should be the safest.\r\n\r\nFour of Jesus' Disciples were fishermen, and Jesus helped them catch fish before they became Disciples. I'm sure you have eaten fish in your life. How many babies have you dined on? We have, by God's word, dominion over every other creature on the earth... including fish.

No kidding!  This show should be AX'ed yesterday!  These women are spoiled brats who are self centered and have no "heart". Someone needs to show them what is like to live poor. No one cares about how they show off their money-- expensive shopping trips, private jets, limos and the castle homes, and spoiled vacations....  then "poor me" garbage attitudes.  There are more important issues in the world-- how about donating to charity and doing something "good" for the world. Get rid of this show ASAP... we need to get these votes going. Let's bring on some good TV instead!!

If any money should run dry, it should be the massive amounts of money we give to foreign countries, not the money spent to help disaster victims in this country, especially when that  money comes from those very disaster victims and other US tax payers. Where did this mentality come from that foreign countries are more important than our own people?  I was taught that when you are in too much debt, you quit giving money away and spending on frivilous things and take care of your responsibilities at home.

Yes, w/ 3 kids of my own, I believe Christie made the the right decision.  With so many families devestated by Sandy's destruction, having additional days to recover will help moms & dads get the kids costumes ready.

If Romney wins..this country will run the Special Interest groups who donated millions to his campaign.  Why would anyone vote for this clown..you would have to be Un-informed, Stupid or just plain Racist or All of the Above!!

Once during my year in between the military and college I decided to back pack  across the country to hook up with a good high school friend I grew up with.  I was naive to how many people were out to rob and steal, and not having the money for a motel every night, or a hostel, I took to sleeping in large cemeteries.   Not only did I sense a feeling of peace and tranquility,  I also did not encounter any human guests during the wee hours of the night and morning.   Incidentially I do love cemeteries and have been to some great ones in our country, from the civil war up to and including those who housed soldiers from world war I on up.  National cemeteries are of course for our veterans,  but private cemeteries can have 2 story memorials like pieces on a chessboard.  They are beautiful.

the pope says it's ok because music director..  do you have absolute proof that OBAMA is not a CHRISTIAN,, if so tell us about and inform us as to where we can find the same..  you know how stupid you make your self look with this religious crap, there are ministers and more preaching politics from the pulpit  that is wrong and they should lose their tax status \r\noh yes catholics are "christians" so they say  but they have thousands of "men of the cloth" in hiding, because they are CHILD MOLESTERS or is that different..  if thi8s election was all about religion it would be wrong..   plus how many religions have to kiss rings, pray to a statue splash water on themselves..  \r\na large number of protestant churches are no more christian than my foot is.telling people they can't they can't worship with them \r\nI mean take Sarah Palin and her daughter, who should have been stoned according to your bible because she was having a child out of wed lock\r\nSo where do you draw the line.. do you continue to be a racist, a bigot, and a hypocrite or will you follow the bible like you should.

Huckabee is a hypocrite - it has been reported that he used his political clout to cover up the most heinous animal abuse to a dog ever recorded in his state by his own son.  Some Christians seem to believe that it's okay to do whatever you want to an animal - I believe a righteous person takes care of every living thing.

Ray Nagin (mayor of New Orleans during Katrina) is the reason the people suffered during Katrina. Ray Nagin refused the help that FEMA and President Bush stood by waiting to give. Ray Nagin refused to use the hundreds of school buses to take people out of harms way and which ended up being swamped. Ray Nagin is the reason Bobby Jindal (Republican) was elected the Governor in 2007 & 2011. \r\n Democrats in recent years have totally turned from any moral value system and have in turn have lacked common sense.  I am thankful that President Obama has been in the White House the past four years.  He guarantees a Romney win and a return to sanity. \r\n WAKE UP AMERICA

I think it will be great.  Not going to go into all the reasons why, but I don't see Disney going off into left field with it.  They know, as much as anyone, how important it is to stay canon and do it justice.  And for those who say they can't..  well.. Disney bought Marvel IP and everyone seems to be loving the Iron Man movies and, well, just about all the other Marvel movies that have come out since Disney took over.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I'm not so sure about, is how Disney is starting to film some stuff in China - with their partner - DMG Entertainment.  While I think China and the US could eventually have a great partnership as nations, they have a long way to go before they are ready - like stop manipulating currency - stop stealing our tech - stop undermining democracy - and FFS stop repatriating North Korean refugees!!!

For the love of God give it up all ready!!! I have gone from respecting Donald Trump as an intelligent business man to thinking he is either a total and complete moron or now has a substance abuse problem. If you are so eager to give money to help people do it with out the strings attached. There are many out there who need the help due to the storm which just devistated their lives. Not everyone has the money to take off somewhere safe. Put up and or shut up! Stupidity is very unbecoming. Please Stop making a fool of your self and please never consider running for office again. There are more than enough idiots that shouldn't be representing the people of this country, we do not need one more. Help charities out of the goodness of your heart as that is how it should be. Doing it out of some delusional condition attached offer just is plain wrong!!!!

OBAMA WILL GO DOWN AS ONE OF THE WORST PRESIDENTS IN HISTORY! Likely lower than G. W. Bush even. \r\n  \r\nObama created nearly all the damages of Deepwater Horizon so-called 'oil spill' in the Gulf of Mexico. Lots of people know how to stop leaks that will happen from spreading in the turbulent North Sea east of Great Britain. OBAMA WOULD NOT LET THEM HELP! \r\n  \r\nHe issued the ignorant moratoriums on fishing and new oil drilling. That oil reserve is 35,000,000 years old - much larger 'leaks' than the Deepwater Horizon incident have occurred naturally. \r\n  \r\nCrude oil tar balls washed onto shores from Florida to California naturally long before oil wells went in - oil was skimmed from Texas Gulf marshes and hauled to east coast factories to fuel our industrial revolution in the mid-1800's. \r\n  \r\nOBAMA IS AN ANTI-BUSINESS MORON - a lowly Cook County Illinois (corruption) lawyer that never even ran his own legal business! \r\n  \r\nWe don't have to talk about Romney - OBAMA MUST BE DEFEATED!

I actually found that I had more money after ending a relationship because I wasn't expected to spend money all the time. My ex liked to go out all the time, but my salary was less than half of his. Even though he was generous, I still insisted on picking up the tab on things that were more within my reach. After we split, I cut back on going out to eat and to all the other activities we constantly did and suddenly saved a lot of money. It was actually nice to be at home too.

Looks to me like you're the idiot. The question was, After Sandy, will Romney support FEMA. He's already said he wouldn't but he's keeping his mouth shut for now. Next he'll be flip flooping again and you'll still be an idiot leaving comments that have nothing to do with the article. You ignorant racist.

"Well, if we were not here looking at things as they happen it would be hard to believe, even comical....The scumbags that unfortunately not drown these last 2 days are again doing their thing..."\r\n\r\nYou need to stop calling the general public- scumbags and make sure you grasp that Goldman Sachs has manipulated America into the worst most precarious financial condition in it's history. What we all saw this morning was cumulative lift from two days of backroom bank negotiations with the Fed. What we are seeing now is the Reality and gravity of hired-in executives, who, for just two extra days after a weekend, couldn't keep what they've run into the ground... running. No scumbags or manipulators out here, but a number of agencies are confirming the BLOCKADE of viable skilled experienced and able people from jobs they should be doing. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to tie that to major Republican & GOP Super PAC contributors. Goldman Sachs has already admitted to massive contributions and a FALSE CLAIM that We the People are not counted in the election of the President, just bought and paid-for bureaucrats. The markets are dead, freedom and free enterprise are not. Republicans are manipulators but they won't be in control much longer... in GITMO, but in control? Not.

Actually I don't think the man is trying to get voted out of office. He has a valid point. If the government helps these victims from the storm. There are more important things to spend the money on than Gucci bags and massage parlors.If these people cannot figure that out then this nation has a bigger problem.  Some of you folks need a reality check. When someone reaches out and helps another person. That individual should be realistic and spend the money on food and proper clothes,maybe gas if they have a vehicle. Not on luxury items. Luxury items come later,when they can afford it themselves. One does not have to suffer to know that Gucci bags and massage parlors are not the first and foremost needs of a storm victim. I think there are readers on here that need a reality check as well.

It is not that I am so for Obama. It is that I am so against Romney.

People are we as a nation so blind that we can not see what is happening.\r\nMany have eyes and can not see. Have ears but can not hear. \r\n\r\n\r\n22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, \r\n23 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four footed beasts, and creeping things. \r\n24 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: \r\n25 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen. \r\n26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: \r\n27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. \r\n28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; \r\n29 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, \r\n30 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, \r\n31 Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: \r\n32 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.

You are all looking for any reason to hate Obama. Do you always believe every single thing you read in print as the gospel truth; or just when it fits your needs? They ALL lie!!!! Every single one of them lie!!!! Well then I guess I pick Obama’s lies over Romney’s and Bush’s lies any day. Four people got killed!!!!! Sorry, but 6, 630 people have been killed in two wars; now that is what really matters. The entire region is a volatile mess, but it is their Countries and not our Country. Ambassador Christopher Stevens knew what he was getting into and he knew the risks; just like a solider knows and understands the risk of war. You act as if they had more security that would of stopped the attacks. Well, when there is a will, there sure as hell is a way; especially if you are a terrorist and that is your reason for living. You all act like you are sitting in the White House and you all are arm chair mini presidents. Get over your self. This incident is minor in the huge picture of the United States of America. Perfidious!!!!! Show me one that hasn’t been!!!!!!!

I would have to agree with this list.  Most of the shows I have never wasted my time watching but the ones I have need to go.  I have never gotten into any of these reality shows and don't get why people watch them.  Too shallow for me.  I miss the old westerns that used to be on, now that was entertainment.

OK let me get this. \r\n Mitt Romney was in Ohio sending supplies to NJ and NYC. \r\n hahahahahahahahahah duhhhhhhhhhh \r\n He is in a Swing State where the president abandoned his campaign to tend to the tragedy and he Mitt goes to Ohio on a "non-campaign" event to send boxes to NJ/NYC hahahahahahahahaha \r\n I can see this guy will do anything, just anything and straight up and lie. \r\n I mean at least admit it and say F it I am campaigning or I am not campaigning.  But no he says he is not but he is. He says he is but is not. \r\n I can see why he ran a venture capital Firm just a bunch of let's make a deal guys and **** what we believe in, we believe in $$$$$!!!

By supporting a strong military, he is supporting disaster relief in the US and it is already in the budget.  By lowering taxes, generous individuals have more money to personally give to charitable organizations like Red Cross, Samaritans Purse, etc that are first responders during major national disastors.  So, yes, Romney supports caring for the nation adter a disaster.  He just doen't need another bureaucracy to make it happen.
1
Phinster- You don't know what in the hell your talking about. It appears Romney is taking CHANCES on our country by cutting FEMA. I don't want him as president!! Its like saying if NYC gets flooded then too damn bad cause we no longer have FEMA. Yes, thats how stupid you sound.

What kind of morons actually believe that Romney wanted the auto industry to fail?  What a bunch of un-informed idiots.  If you would actually do some research on exactly what a bankruptcy is rather than expecting the government to figure it out for you, you would know that a managed bankruptcy would actually help the company.  Many companies have gone through it in the past and come out much, much stronger.  Several of the major airline have done this and are better off for it.\r\n \r\nSo until you do your homework, quit saying that Romney wanted the auto industry to fail!

Fragu, bigred, Judy, Rserp, and all other uninformed and misinformed libtards.\r\nHundreds of trucks of supplies have been on the road from LDS storehouses since Friday and Saturday on their way to the States hit by Sandy.   LDS are always among the first to respond to disasters, because it is church policy to do so.  They do not advertize it and prefer to help anonymously.  Thousands of people found shelter at LDS chapels during Katrina.   Come next Sunday when they pay their tithing and other offerings, you can bet that LDS all over the world will be contributing to the Sandy disaster fund, just like they have done for every other disaster for years,\r\n \r\nLDS are not conscientious objectors as you uninformed idiots think.  They serve just like everyone else.  They also are preferred for selection to the FBI and Secret Service and are the majority of those in those two agencies.\r\n \r\nDo your research before you spout your mindless garbage about the LDS.   Ask the Salvation Army and Catholic Charities who their biggest supplier of emergency supplies is.   Ask Catholic Charities who devised the liquid meal formula for starving children and supplied it to them to distribute to the Ethiopians years ago and still does so.   \r\nOtherwise STFU.

While we're at it, let's grab an even bigger axe and chop away at a few worthless networks too.  I'd start with the inaccurately-named TruTV and the saccharinic vanity project known as OWN.  And if we could do a little pruning to the MTV tree, maybe lopping off its lowest-common-denomi  ​ nator "reality show" division, I doubt that many folks with adequate IQs would mourn the loss.  And finally, any network which dares to air the Dr Oz Show needs to meet not an axe but a chainsaw.

Romney says he wants to send disaster relief back to the states, or send it to the private sector, which he says is even better.  He should start "Walking The Talk" by giving some of his millions directly to the families in New Jersey and New York who have lost everything in this hurricane.  I'd be willing to bet that not only does he not give millions, he won't give a cent!!!!    If elected, I heard he would be the richest president in history by far.    He was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and can not relate to the everyday struggle of the middle class.  Obama is not perfect; but, he gets what it is to struggle.

Two and a Half Men should have been Cancelled when Charlie Sheen was removed from the cast, they attempted to jump the shark by bringing the brainless idiot and have failed then they have attempted by bringing in Hannah Montana and have Failed now they trying to bring back Rose guess what they havn't figured out the issue is the show was built around charlie sheen not this idiot attempting to take his place.

I have read many of the posts and have re listened to the ad.I would ask you.... Did you ever hear Huckabee state who to vote for? Mention any of the two people running for the office?\r\n \r\nI know he didn't.... just as you do.\r\n \r\nHe basically said make your choice based on two very important issues,the protection of innocent children and the sanctany of marriage between a man and a woman.25 years ago would of this postion been considered strange or radical? \r\n \r\nWhy do you feel his position on these two points are wrong? What I find the most interesting if these believes would of been the norm in the past you might not of been here to speak up.

I think that the question is stupid... However, it is easy to see the connection between hurricanes and Dem females....Much like hurricanes, we're fast, we run circles around others....And most of all, there's nothing anyone can do to stop us.

Ok- being prepared is not the same as ability to deploy resources where they're needed - which I think is what you're getting at. We all know the FEMA fiasco with Katrina. I saw the National Guard, with boots on the ground, providing aid and comfort to those victims in New Orleans & within hours of Sandy's passing. I think your point would be better focused on FEMA's non-effectiveness. These deployments of resources would be handled much more efficiently with the National Guard/ Red Cross efforts. Perhaps FEMA can be phased in with these & eliminate wasteful government spending.

Actually since its really a wild weed that will grow just about anywhere and since its leaves without the bud is considered hemp which makes clothes, hats, and other items that we use everyday..

Umm you people arent addicted to nicotene in a cigerette your addicted to rat poicon and syinide poison.. Thats why the nicotene patch don 't work..

Many more could be added to this list. Why do producers think we need to be encouraged to "laugh" with so many inappropriate laugh tracks? Much of what they want us to laugh at isn't even remotely funny! And the Kardashians and Duggars are the pits of entertainmant. Good thing the History and Smithsonian channels have some fair programing (not referring to the pawn jerks).

Do not confuse Godly principles with Mormon principles. Even if you vote for President Obama or Romeny that does not garuntee certain laws will be passed. This is not a dictaorship. Those bills still have to go through Congress and Congress can approve or reject them as they deem or fit. (Or do what they've been doing and just sit on them for until people forget about it) I voted 3rd party this year; I find the current crop of Presidential Candidates (ie the ones the media hand picked and forced down my throat) to be pathetic. Romney's God is that of Mormonism and Mormonism is the grounds for a tolitarian Theocracy. I don't want that. You shouldn't want that. Since all nations fall anyway, don't believe you have to vote for A or B Candidate. Vote how you want.

Jon Cryer is a wonderful actor and I do not want to see this show go away.

If he wrote a check then you would all say that he's trying to buy votes. If you hate someone you're going to fault whatever they do, Obama or Romney.

And that is a fine stance to take as long as that candidate does not bring his religious beliefs to the office with him.

I have it. Set the movie on the ice planet Hoth. Cast Kate Upton as the lead. The story is that the base in under attack. There are spaceship explosions, and one crashes into the base setting off the sprinkler system. Kate Upton is awoken from hyper sleep, and dressed in bikini bottoms and a short white t-shirt runs across the base through the freezing cold water spray looking for her spaceship. But doesn't find it for at least two hours. In slo-mo. Close up. In the end she is rescued by Olga Kurylenko, Charlize Theron, Scarlett Johansen, Sophie Vergara, Selena Gomez, Carly Rae Jepson, Katie Perry, Olivia Wilde, and Miranda Kerr, who are all naked for some reason. \r\n Best. Movie. Ever.

I think he should be removed from TV all together. I do not criticize his views or beliefs but I do not think he should be allowed a TV pulpit.  \r\n  \r\nI sincerely hope that all voters learn the issues and vote their heart. I will vote for Romney but not because he agrees with me on anything or everything. I am an independent and just think he is best for this country and for all of the American people regardless of their beliefs.

Great post Laser. Hey I voted for Bush and people seem to forget how bad those eight years were. Obama came into the presidency with a huge hill to climb, thanks to the Bush years. I'm not saying he has done the best job, but I believe he has tried... I don't believe either party has the right answers. They spend too much time fighting each other rather than working together. Our politicians are completely out of touch with us!!

Nobody is saying that gays dont have the right to live any way they want. What they ARE saing is that they should not expect the GOVERNMENT to legitimize their lifestyle, nor to advocate for it.

Get this woman a mental evaluation, then, if she's competent, charge her with the crimes she's committed.  She could have ruined three men's lives had it not been for very good detective work. This woman has very serious issues.  Whether or not she's insane, that's up to the professionals to decide.  Everyone was so quick to condemn the three supposed white racists, but they don't want to hold this black woman responsible for her actions.  Where's the justice and equality?  Oh, that only apparently works one way.

I think it is safe to say that Apple has seen it's high and the stock will continue down over the next few years. When Apple announced their stock buy back was one of the first moves to indicate the stock future is down. One major reasons for stock buy backs is to keep EPS up by removing the number of shares in the market.

Michael Brown is an idiot and as a former FEMA employee I know what I'm talking about.  He led this agency with no background experience, period, resulting in the worst response effort ever in relief of Katrina.  His only experience was in raising Arabian horses.  Addtionally, prior to 9/11 FEMA was an independent agency.  After 9/11 it was consumed by Homeland Security as well as it's funds and resources taking from it their ability to react without the need to confront more bureaucracy than before.  Both Brown and Bush failed New Orleans as well as other parts of Louisianna by their incompetence.  A natural disaster of this magnitude (Sandy)?  That's what you do you lame duck, you mitigate and prepare to minimize damage and loss of life.  This is exactly why your are sitting the side lines licking your wounds for being found the incompetent, unqualified, idiot you were when you held that office.

I liked Bush and still do (I know, I know).  But it is asinine for Brownie to criticize the Pres. Obama for getting ahead of the storm.  You can call Obama's 'jumping the gun' an election tactic all you want. .  All it says to me is that the Pres. and his staff are not going to let this turn into another Katrina.  It's painfully obvious that the Bush admin wasn't prepared for it and I for one am glad that the current admin understands what needs to be done as far as preparations, etc for an event like this.  Someone finally got it.  It's about time.  Maybe it saved 50 lives.  I don't care if they were gutter dwellers and addicts.  Maybe it saved hundreds.  Either way lives were probably saved.  I don't care what way you lean politically, that's a good thing.

I agree with most of your choices that should be axed but you need to add DWTS. The judges have lost all their skill in voting, they gave Kirstie Alley way to many points & she is the worst dancer for this series of dancers.

I beleive everyone has to vote their conscious and we cannot control the faith of the person running.  I am a Christian and I may not agree with either opponet but I do believe we have a higher power to answer to, no matter what we do in life.  Hucabee's trying to reach peoples who are believers in our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, and I agree with him but my vote ( which is done ) is based on what we see around us. Look around folks.  Where's America's morals heading? Did our four fathers want a leader, who bows down to other leaders in other countries, ( as if they were Gods ). A leader who travels the world apologizing for America and what she has done or not done! NO DEAR FELLO AMERICANS, THEY WOULD NOT AND NOR DO I.  I WANT A LEADER WHO STANDS FOR MORALS, WHO WILL STAND UP FOR AMERICA INSTEAD OF APOLOGIZING. WE ARE A PROUD COUNTRY AND PROUD OF OUR HERITAGE. THINK BEFORE YOU VOTE. I STAND WITH HUCKABEE. I PRAY FOR GOD TO GRACE OUR COUNTRY ONCE AGAIN BUT WE WILL ONLY RECEIVE HIS WRATH, SHOULD WE TURN OUR BACKS ON HIM. MY VOTE IS FOR A TRUE AMERICAN THAT BELIEVES IN GOD'S MORALS.  OUR COUNTRY WAS BUILT ON FAITH AND PRIDE. LET'S GET IT BACK

Been to Italy many times. These homes are not your typical middle-upper middle class home/apartment. My friend's family is from a town about 30 miles NE of Venice called Portogruaro. TRUST me these homes belong to multimillionaires...  ​ .that avoid taxes like the plague! The average college educated kid lives at home with an extended family mama and daddy, etc. and is working on their terminal degree since there are no jobs and forget about selling a house that's why it stays "in the family"!

Just a thought, but where does he get his " "The right to life from conception to natural death"\r\nto be found in the bible ?\r\n \r\nI'm not saying I dont agree, so dont get me wrong... I just realize that they quote the bible so much,,, what about that one? where is bible tells us that !??

I never claimed WHO I was voting for, or not voting for, in this presidential election beyond stating I would not vote for Obama. You can assume what you will, but that privilage is between me and my stylus. Be careful about assumptions.\r\n \r\nWhat is fact is Michael Browne did our country, and those that died during and after Katrina, a terrible disservice. Obama made the East Coast a priority over his campaign during the worst storm this country has ever seen. Right or wrong, whatever reason he had, he made the citizens of this country feel wanted and important for a few short hours. I'm not including or disregarding what happened last week, last month or last year; just the last 36 hours.

So Romney's not just a liar...but a danger to Americans as well. Remember when he said he wanted to cut the number of firefighters as well??  Romney's so out of touch, I expect him at any minute to ask people to move to their summer homes until the disaster is over.

To funny as Chris Christie is being interviewed by fox. The question was asked would you allow Romney to tour NJ with you. Just before Christie could answer you could see just under Christie the announcement that Romney would be touring Sandy with Christie.  \r\n  \r\nThe funny part is Christe answered by saying   I have no idea, nor am I the least bit concerned or interested,” he said. “I’ve got a job to do here in New Jersey that’s much bigger than Presidential politics, and I could care less about any of that stuff.”

I saw this movie...my husband said he felt like he was watching six movies and once and I felt it was a never ending movie trailer.

Why don't you admit it, you wouldn't like Obama if he waved his hand and repaired all the damage.  Even Gov. Christie thinks the prez has handled this well.  You're like the people who think RomneyCare was wonderful, but ObamaCare is socialist.  Guess what? Repulican Senators Grassley (Iowa) and Hatch(Utah)sponsored  ​   health care legislation which included a MANDATE until President Obama adopted Romney's health care plan...then they thought it was unconstitutional!  The hypocrisy on the right is truly astounding.

Heartwarming story timbow! I have many fond memories of trick-or-treating as a child. I am 48 now and no-one much trick or treats in my neighborhood anymore. I can relate to taking my grandson trick-or-treating and not having much participation in neighborhoods despite walking for miles. If handing out free beer would increase participation count me in for a donation!

Thanks to FEMA people ATLEAST now had a trailer to go to instead of the streets or some over crowded homeless shelter. WHERES YOUR HUMAN DECENCY?!

Mr. Huckabee, your hypocrisy knows no bounds.  According to the scriptures that I follow, LOVE is the greatest thing that we can do. 1 Cor. 13:13.  Not politic.  Of course, you being a scholar of theology know this.  You know that how one lives their life (let their light so shine) is how we lead others to Christ.\r\n\r\nWe are to care for the widows, orphans, and strangers. James 1:2, Deut.  It's not ALL about money; as your ads seemed to intimate.\r\n\r\nSo go ahead, YOU follow Mr. Romney.  Because according to your denomination, Mormonism is a cult. SMH @ your shamelessness. \r\n\r\nPres. Obama may not get everything right, but who among us has.\r\n\r\nHe is a PROFESSED Christian and we do know that he is concerned about the least of us.\r\nUnlike Mr. 47%er.

Understand you completely, Thinker.  She does have a tendency to use hyperbole and substitute misinformation from time to time.  And yes, she owes an apology for mishandling your actual service...for which I am always the first to thank you guys (and gals)....\r\n\r\nI just think she is somewhat misguided and of course, she is in the bandwagon of capital, and so tends to espouse the needs of capital over labor.  We are all a bit \r\nprejudiced these days and the campaign has only increased the vitriol.  Deep down, she wants the country to succeed....I only wish she could see the clear path toward that is by REFUSING to re-elect the same old 'principles' which nearly ground us into the dirt the last several times.  \r\n\r\nHang in there.

A little friendly suggestion, if you want to attempt to take a position of higher intellect, which, judging by your first statement was part of your goal, then you should really consider taking a lesson in reading comprehension so you don't make a fool of yourself next time. As someone you probably don't like said...attack the issue, not me if you don't agree. Where in my post does it say a thing about others doing this first? (hint, that was rhetorical, it doesn't). But that said...I have to ask....did you just come out of a 10 year coma or something....perhaps  ​  you were stranded on an island? Do you really,..I mean really believe that the media is unbiased? That is the only thing that both parties mutually agree on for crying out loud...please don't take that from them. What are you going to say next? That is like saying Hollywood isn't either? 99% of the Democrats and 99% of the Republicans will join hands together on this and tell you how ridiculous they think your statement is.. Ask a group of Democrats if they like Fox news and have them tell you why not...then ask a group of Republicans if they like MSN and have them tell you why not. That alone will show you how far off you are from reality. Perhaps you need to heed your advise, but remember that in order to "wake up and get real" you need to open your eyes first.

Remain as creative and fresh? I doubt it. The Star Wars story isn't particularly unique. (Sorry but it's not) And it has been proven, via Episodes 2 and 3, that lightsabers seem pretty redundant after a while. They lose their... iconic image. While I confess I wouldn't mind seeing a couple of the stories (namely that of Exar Kun) brought to the big screen; Hollywood has not been Creative or Fresh in a very, very long time.

Unfortunately, what he's afraid of happening is valid.  So many victims of Katrina blew the money they received on frivolous things.  Wait.....whose money is it?  Oh yeah, OURS!!!!  And those are some of the people voting for Obama.  God forbid they should lose their handouts.  I feel bad for the people who REALLY DESERVE the support.  There's always the few that ruin things for the rest.

Do yourself a favor and research the number of children in orphanages in the USA! These are children no one wants or else they wouldn't be orphans.  Now let us add say  100-150,000 more children to this list every year.  The Christian thing to do is force women to have children than warehouse the children for next eighteen years and what do we have my friend.  WHY AREN'T YOU SO DEEPLY RELIGIOUS FOLKS OPENING YOUR HEARTS TO THESE CHILDREN AND GIVING THEM THE LOVING CHRISTIAN HOME THEY DESERVE?

I suppose the handouters that had their homes destroyed will want government help. When Romney's elected and cuts all these foolish give away agencies like FEMA's funding we'll put a stop to that. Not with my money.

He is right on most issues he sees as being faulty.    The waste is tremendous as it is with most Govt. agencies, of course Obama people cannot see that just like they can't see period. \r\n This Detroit bankruptcy thing is a classic example of what they say and think.    Chapter 11 IS an opportunity for large Companies to regroup.    They get protection under the Bankruptcy plan ANS Federal money to regroup and get back on their own feet without the Welfare Obama wants to give them.    Look it up smart Obama Fans, read up on it. \r\n Just like your words Someone,  You have no clue.     Just put this guy back in for another term, then stand up, put your head between your knees, and kiss your **** goodbye,  WE WILL BE FINISHED!!

You did not get it baby. \r\n FEMA = Federal Government. \r\n Mitt says that Government is inefficient and that if it could be passed to the states great and if it could be privatize even better. \r\n Chris Christie was a key note speaker to the RNC and had stated that Obama was an incapable leader. \r\n I don't think he is saying that now ok!

Okay, enough is enough. It is the current president who is forcing the same kind of socialist health care model that is failing MISERABLY in Europe right now down our throats. It is the current president who has promised to rob 700 BILLION dollars from Medicare to pay for it. It is the current president who sent MILLIONS of $ in 'stimulus' to 'green companies', some of which spent every dollar then went bankrupt. It is the current president who CONTINUES to unabashedly deny THOUSANDS of good paying jobs to hard working Americans by blocking completion of the Canadian oil pipeline. Under this presidents watch HIS administration implemented a cock-a mamie policy called 'fast and furious' which sold guns to drug runners ostensibly to track them back to drug lords. But one of those guns was used to murder a federal agent near a border to Mexico that LOOOONG ago should have been closed. THIS president talks'a plenty about a 'path to citizenship' for people who entered this country illegally. But he cant bring himself to firmly attach himself to ANY comprehensive plan to stop people from coming here by breaking the law. And you folk want ANOTHER 4 years of this? REALLY??? Not me. Nope...nada...nyet...not a chance. I will vote for change in less than a week now. Change is coming, and not a moment too soon. Get ready for it....consult your check list; crying towels? Excuses?

The key to making a great Star Wars movie is to give the new movie the same feel that you have when you watch the original three.  Just like when you watch a John Hughes movie.  Like Home Alone, Ferris Buellers Day off and Planes, Trains and Automobiles.  Those movies have a certain feel to them that screams John Hughes.  So when they make the next Star Wars they need to capture that feeling viewers get when watching the original 3 Star Wars episodes 4, 5 & 6.  Then they'll have movie success.  George Lucas wanted to make a movie that was reminicent of the old sci-fi movie serials of his childhood.  Episode IV had that feel and as technology and special effects advanced they gradually got farther and farther away from that "feel" as the first.  Still, 4, 5 & 6 had that "feel" far more than 1, 2 & 3 which didn't feel like Star Wars at all.   \r\n  \r\nSteer away from the mistakes that Lucas made when Episode 1, 2 & 3 were made.   \r\n  \r\nI think Disney can do it, but they have to be very smart about it.  They can't make it a futuristic Pirates of the Carribean.  That just won't work and POC has a totally different feel to the movie.

I do hope this family is putting some of this money away for the child's future and theirs as well.  From what little I know of them, I would guess their reality career is short-lived.   I do not watch reality TV, never have, never will.  There's enough drama in most family's lives.  I can't imagine wanting to tune in and get caught up in other family's drama.  But then again, maybe it's a harmless escape from one's own problems.

I'm not sure how to react to this. Lucasarts is/was the forefather to all this CGI that is in movies now and George did a damn good job with 4,5,6 and ET and a host of other sci-fi movies.\r\n\r\nHere is the issue for me, episodes 7,8,9 are supposed to take place right after The Return of the Jedi......has anyone seen a recent pic of Carrie Fisher? how about Harrison Ford? Mark Hamil?\r\n\r\nAll of the actors are either fat or to old to play the younger versions of themselves. Unless Disney is making the Geritol Star Wars episodes they are going to have to replace the characters......this  ​  will make the movies quite lame. Another issue I see is if the characters are replaced by current young actors, who do you get? acting skill is far removed from Hollywood now, just look at all the remakes they are doing, more and more cgi,explosions,sex,a  ​ nd wire acts, less on character development and near nothing on plot and good dialog. Star Wars was not the best with character development,plot,act  ​ ing, and dialog either but it had the right mix and that is why the movie stays with us decade after decade. It was a good all around movie, quite similar to Blade Runner.  All the special effects and computer graphics in the world can't beat that.......I hope for Disney and for the Star Wars legacy that they do some heavy screening for these movies and use some models instead of relying on digital graphics to pull the films along.....

Yes he did.  The Gov's of each state had already issued their warnings and to get a message from the fed level just increases the risk of conflicting messages.  The Pres needed to (which he did) call each gov and major mayor and let them know fed money was on its way.\r\n \r\nWhere was the president last year when Irene tore through this area?  Nowhere, that's where.  If Irene had happened during an election year, he would have been here!

Well Jimbobwe3599.... \r\n  \r\n1.  I AM a Democrat , and I have never  asked for, needed OR received any government assistance at any time  in taking care of my family, providing a college education for my children, neither did my parents or grand parents.   And I am black and I pay taxes... The real reason our country is what you want to call needy is because greedy corporations continue to ship jobs out of this country ,  and the rich  ( REPUBLICANS  SUCH AS MITT ROMNEY) are content being rich while the people who do the work that they depend on are shi_tted on daily. \r\n  \r\n2. Brownie may not have built the trailers.... but he personally advocated that the cheapest building materials be used in building the trailers...  \r\n  \r\n3. And comments like yours leads me to hope that you yourself are one day struck by disaster and need help or assistance and your words are thrown back in your face.  providing assistance in times of need to those who TRULY need help does not weaken this country , It strengthens us, AS A NATION AND AS INDIVIDUALS ...

A) Your statement that no war involving America has been about freedom is false, even if we ignore foreign wars for freedom (do you think South Vietnam or South Korea weren't fighting for their freedom when we got involved, really?) You completely left out the War of 1812, the war for Texas Independence (arguable as an "American" war, but I include it because a large percentage of those involved were from the U.S.), or the Civil War. Yes, the Civil War was fought over, among other issues, freedom. To suggest that every war since the American Revolution was just corporate greed is just ridiculous.\r\n\r\nB) As a former American serviceman myself, I want to say that if you should ever find yourself being assaulted by a foreign power, anywhere in the world, my fellows will gladly step in to protect you in every way they can. This despite them being, as you put it, "brainwashed kids". No need to thank them; they *volunteered* to do it.

I would hazard a guess that this policy has to do less with disrespecting the soldiers, and more with respecting the uniform.  When I was in college in a sorority, we were not allowed to drink while wearing our Greek letters, because if you end up behaving in a way that reflected badly on the sorority, it is best not to do so in a visible manner.  Drinking in uniform while out and about is, I think, discouraged in the military...am I wrong?  Isn't this why they change into civvies when they get leave?

I agree that the critics and msn are wrong on this show. It is really funny and doesn't belong on this list...I agreed with the other choices but not this one. Whitney is hilarious, she reminds me of a neurotic Louie CK. In case you didn't notice, it got high viewer ratings, which speaks volumes more than the critics' panning.

Any reality TV show that is basically just showing us how "other people" live with the exception of shows that feature people from minority cultures and are limited to no more than half a season for any one culture. Any reality TV show that is about a child or children under 14 competing for anything. Any reality TV show with cast members under 14, period. Any reality TV show requiring "cast members" to have made bad life choices. Any reality TV show that is about dating, mating or marriage. Half of the crime shows. Basically try to give us something less depressing to watch! Other than that I don't know. I don't watch much TV. Spongebob should be changed to an adults only show and only aired on late night TV.

I think the people from Jersey and sourounding will figure a way to get way too much aid money through their political influences, and rebuild their lavish coastal homes, putting extra spoils in their pockets at whatever opportunity arises!!  These people, however unfortunate regarding the storm, are not the people in our country who have failed at getting their ways.

With as far as the books have gone in the storyline, itll be easy for them to adapt them to the big screen. will be awesome to see where they go. I would be more worried with disney doing this if it were not what they've done with marvel's storylines. They know what they are doing and i hope my faith is fulfilled.

Why not take some of these actors, put them in different shows and spice up the small screen for a change.  I'm tired of talent shows, except for Ryan Secrest. Tired of reality shows.  Please more sitcoms.  No more cop/detective shows, they are ready beating this crap into the ground.  Already trying to make them look like the guys in the white hats, they are not!  Need to fired them all and start over again.

It is truly amazing that any repuke dunce can be so braindead as to believe that slapped **** lyin Willardo, the Mexican Mormon Moron tax evading draft dodger has any plan to save our country. He should have said he was going to create 50 million jobs and have everyone working in his first 4 years. The dumb sheep that believe him without any plan to do so, except lower taxes on his criminal corporate masters, is a joke. \r\nHis campaign manager called him an Etch A Sketch player. He changes his lies daily, depending on which group he speaks to.

All we can go by is what both candidates claim to be. Romney claims to be Mormon, and Obama claims to be Christian. People have come up with this insane idea that because he wore some type of jewelry for years he is a Muslim, and because he respects Muslim countries, those are his Muslim brothers. So, if you want to be stupid enough to agree with the people who have come to that conclusion about Obama, then ok, whatever makes you happy. However, for Huckabee to say something like this is quite interesting. Mormons and Christians have very different views; they are NOT the same, so tell me what does God watching have to do with that? Finally, he ought to be ashamed to even bring God into something like that. Does he not know that God was watching him when he made that statement and God does not like ugly. I am so sick and tired of all these people claiming to be Christians thinking they can go around spreading all this ugliness and hate on people. Doesn't the Bible say not to judge? Okay, for those of you who say you are to judge righteously, by doing all what he did, is that really holy? Gosh, I really cannot wait til these elections are over because I am so sick and tired of always hearing about this stupid, shallow crap..

I dont like president BO, but why is this guy saying the president responded too quickly.  Heck, people are still bitchin because Bush didn't respond quickly enough during Katrina.

exactly why does everyone think that sheltering the sh*t out of kids is a good idea?  i'm not saying that i'd take my kid to the playboy mansion or somewhere where people are using drugs in the open, but i'm not going to stop going anywhere because i have a kid.  i don't shirk my responsibilities.  my kid is with me whenever she's not in school.  i don't like using sitters.  i'd rather take her with me, act responsibly, and have a good time WITH my kid.  we're pretty much the only family each other has.  as long as she's not up past bedtime on a school night or seeing people doing coke or throwing up on themselves, i don't see an issue with it.  i think a lot of the reason that kids don't act responsibly at parties when they're older is that nobody ever showed them that you don't have to act like a f*cking idiot to have a good time.

When I moved to the USA from Australia a decade or so ago I was SO looking forward to taking our kids out for Halloween in our new home town of Orlando, having grown up on all the TV programs and movies that showcased it as such a great time for kids (no, we don't celebrate it in Australia, even though the marketers have tried getting it going in recent years). But talk about a bust! There was nary a light on in our entire neighborhood, and ours was the only house handing out candy. So we stopped trying. Then 3 - 4 years ago we happened to wonder over to another neighborhood a few miles away on some sort of business, and while we were talking to an aquaintance over there the subject of Halloween came up, and I mentioned how dismal our experience had been since moving to Orlando. She piped up and said 'you should try our neighborhood!' So we did, and it was AMAZING! We've been back every years since. We could spend 3 - 4 hours walking the area and still not put a serious dent in the homes with lights on, and the last couple of years there's even been a guy handing out beers to the adults! Needless to say our kids love it and go crazy every year thinking up their costumes, while for me it's a great opportunity to live the experience vicariously through my kids. Every year we feel such gratitude to the people in this area, and every year we feel like writing to the local paper to highlight how wonderful the people are and how grateful we are for the rare opportunity in Orlando for our kids to have such a wonderful experience. But each time we feel like doing so we hold back, because we feel that our public acknowledgement and thanks would prove unwelcome, as it would end up ruining the experience for the local kids by inviting droves of parents from elsewhere in Orlando to bombard the area. We ran it past the friend there last year and she agreed, and just told us to enjoy and accept that we were there by her invitation. She's one of the most extravagant in the area on the night and absolutely revels in it - you can barely see your way to her front door for all the smoke machines running!

Huck is a Schmuck!  He says Mormons are enlightened because Smith dictated the book while covering his face with a hat through which he claims he received the message.  Com'on and the hat said to polygamize?  Any individual or group that believes they are chosen need to be suspected of devilment.  The rules of nature and God don't support such a premise, but serve to create a false basis for favoritism. Beware of false prophets!!   Romney changed it to beware of false profits

There is a reason that there is a separation of church and state. I wont get into the obvious. I personally believe that bringing religion into politics should not be allowed. Religion most certainly does not guarantee a moral or ethical candidate, it has been my experience that politicians use this to sway and deceive voters; and are no more religious and if I may say, less predictable and dependable than your pet pit bull.

God's judgment was not particularly related to homosexuality but the overall wickedness of mankind, he only found Noah and his family to be righteous and therefore the only ones spared  from the flood. God gave mankind over one hundred years to repent before unleashing his righteous judgment.  And the rainbow is a sign that he will not destroy the whole of mankind by flood,  His next judgment will be by fire. (probably nuclear Armageddon) . He loves everyone.  See the gospel of John ch.3 verse 16. "For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life."

Please don't do this to the Star Wars saga!

So you are OK with a president that hides the truth with the American people, puts Americans in harms way, had four Americans killed in Libya because he was coward.  He was so concerned about his run for reelection.  He ran on the fact that terrorismn was on the run.  Then the Embassy was attacked and four Americans were killed.  So what did your honest, truthful president do????? He brush it under the rug, after watching it in real time what was happening.  He is a coward and a liar.

In a way...baby has to grow up. George does need to let the franchise breath. That is a good reason to sell it. i'm not a die hard fan, I want to see a new vision of star wars, it's been a long time coming. We have been caught up in everything that has happened in prequels that the future never emerged. There is always a future; time goes on and have children, lives, and they die. Life goes on even in the cinematic world. I want to see the Empire Destroyed and the Jedi full force. I want to see the children of the war rise up and become more powerful than their parents. I want to see the Millenium Falcon get an overhaul above and beyond. I want to see it all.

I agree with J D.\r\n \r\nThe uberfanboys messed with Lucas way too much. \r\n \r\nStar Wars was ALWAYS a kid friendly franchise. It was never rated R, it never had gore, nudity, any real violence, or bad language. It was just a cool (albeit shallow) story, that was fast-paced, and had cutting edge FX. It created a seemingly infinate universe and spawned tons of books, comics, toys, and games that influenced more than one generation of people.\r\n \r\nPeriod.\r\n \r\nDisney won't change that.

This question is just as biased and stupid as the number of political stories listed today on MSNBC that obviously are posted to further sway voters to think that  and the GOP in general are the big, bad wolves on seeking stability to a fractured and hurting country.  The problem is that many just don't give a damn to find out what the true facts are and are swayed by lies and deceit from main stream media.  It is so apparent to most just how biased the main stream media is in Obama's back pocket!!!

Huckabee's issues?  Abortion?  Same sex marriage?  The God who Huckabee claims to know gives us all free will (choice).  However, some people think they can force their self-righteous will on others in this culture.  Yet they are blind to 'the root of all evil' according to God's Word. And that is the Love of Money.  To be so passionate about conception & so lacking in the knowledge of Romney's life principles & practices.  Buy a company & bankrupt it for a profit, or relocate it overseas for profit. Both at the expense of people losing jobs here,(many with families) and which also affects the communities & other business. Is that the kind of man and respecter of life 'beyond the womb' that we should vote for to score points with God? I hope church-goers stop listening to this right-wing religion and consider the hearts & minds of the two men based on their records before they vote.

GREAT catch CK.....funny how "rex" just created this profile to come on to MSN and ask for assistance.  What happened to contacting the American Red Cross?  I guess MSN would have better answers during a tragedy such as this than the Red Cross, right?  And what is even funnier is how three of the eight postings were made on a thread where you and I are at.....wow, something sure is up with that!!

well not like the billion that has already been waisted to hold this election huh. or the billions in intrest this country is waisting because the agrement that Obama and  Bainer reached on our debt crisis was voteddown by republicans. but yes by all means lets instead focus on worrying about waist on disaster victims and slow down theprocess of helping them

Brownie is an idiot! He botched his job big time and should shut up! Shows what a stupid pig he really is! The president did the right thing telling people to get ready, made them complacent? I dont think so, since when does an early warning make people complacent.  Why won't Republicans just shut up? Oh yea, idiots, just keep talking and remind people of how badly you botched 911 and Katrina!

there is not enough space in this box to describe the stupidity of encouraging Americans not to vote when the country is going down the toilet in the worst way it ever has.  People not voting is a part of the problem you idiot.  If more Americans would have been concerned about Obamas lack of experience and leadership 4 years ago, we would not be in the situation we are in now.  People need to actively participate in politics for any kind of postive change.  Leave it in the Lords hands?  The Lord gave this place to us for us to run.  He is the one putting it in our hands.

So the next time you say whore, ask your self this. WAS YOUR MOM REALLY THE WHORE EVERY ONE ELSE SAID SHE WAS, OR WAS YOUR MOM DIFFERENT BECAUSE SHE WAS YOUR MOM?

I hope not. FEMA should be like flood insurance. Pay the government a monthly premium and you qualify to use it in a disaster that you are in. It's stupid to build anything on a barrier island or with in one mile of the coastline. Should you you do it you, suck it up and take your losses than move to a safer location.

I am voting for the American. I am also voting for the guy that believes babies are small humans when they are conceived and that abortion is murder. I am also voting for the guy that believes marriage should be between a man and a woman. I am also voting for the guy that would send every bit of aid to Americans that were under attack that he could, instead of sitting on his **** and watching them die and then lying about it. I am also voting for the guy that knows something about business and creating jobs instead of how to steal from people that earn to give to those that lay on their a$$. I do agree with Huckabee, but I didn't need him to tell me anything about the POS we have in office right now. And lastly, there is no way Obama is a christian.

He's an idiot who doesn't belong in Congress or any other office of influence and power. With his mentality he'd be ideally suited to work in a toll booth, but that would be offensive to toll booth workers. So he just needs to go back to Iowa and disappear, then finally he'll contribute something worthwhile to America !

As a Christian this is one of the most offensive peices of crap I've seen so far in this election cycle and we've all seen some real crap.  Shame on you Huckabee and everyone who aggrees with this message of hate and lies.

One issue which is rarely discussed is that automobile manufacturers have to market their vehicles at certain price points within the various vehicle's segments.  They also have to make a profit to stay in business.  Besides overhead, the main costs of production are materials and labor.  The issue is the more money spent on labor, the less money available for materials.  The less money spent on materials, the lower the quality.  If American manufacturers are spending 30-50% more for labor than their competitors, I can't see how the quality of their components will ever be as good.

Ya see, DP, assertions are not facts.  The U.S. National Academies of Science as well as the National Academies of Science of other nations have reviewed the science - and they disagree with your "assessment."  More than 95% of actual climate scientists who the actual climate science disagree.  Nearly every major relevant scientific organization disagrees.\r\n\r\nCongressman Inhofe's kangaroo court notwithstanding, the actual scientists doing the actual research think the actual evidence is pretty convincing.  But the actual scientists are driven by understanding, not political, religious, or economic motivations.

This girl needs to move to a small town in Utah or Idaho.  She needs to have a Mormon community teach her how to mange a baseball size team worth of kids, very frugally.  The Mormon’s have all the skills she needs to learn and she will fit right in with her crew of kids.  The added plus would be she just might find a really nice guy that would think that many kids is great.  Plus her kids could have plenty of room to play and grow in a small town.  She could have a garden, and chickens and a cow and feed her kids off the land.

What is really pathetic is that all these Obama haters know full and well that he is a Christian. It isn't as palatable to hate him because he is black so they just question his religion.  They are disgusting hate-mongers.  I mean you have an ultra right wing bible-beating clown pushing for the Mormon?  I hear the race-bating dog whistle loud and clear.
1
It must be embarrassing to be represented by such vile people. I can see why you are not voting. If you aren't a Mormon, Mitt Romeny thinks you are an abomination. "bd on race" either hasn't figured that out yet or is on the take from a church.
1
Huckabee has it spot on, as I have read many comments and all of the negative replies is not replying to what the ad is all about, Marriage between Man and Woman and Right to Life, and Obama is okay with Same Sex Marriage and Abortion, not okay with God and Huckabee is reminding Christian what’s most important., Life is short and God has given us 66 books in the Bible as a guide to Eternity to Heaven!

Romney was asked 14 times today by reporters if he would get rid of FEMA and guess what? To everybody’s surprise he did not answer the question once. I guess he has to talk to his advisers first. Sounds like Mitt Witt put his silver foot in his mouth again too bad it's RIGHT before the ELECTION!!!

The way this guy flip flops of course he will as that is the political thing to do. He was for obamacare before his backers told him not to be. among a long list of things he has backed but now does not or for some audiences. He was against women for an audience now he is for them. He was against the 47% now he supports them. They will have to move all the furniture out of the Wh if he gets elected so he can spin around in there and it is surprising people even vote for this disaster of a man.

Ethiopia is a large country - was this near a city like Adis Ababa or in a remote village?  Probably the former, since the latter might have limited ability to recharge (perhaps none).  If in or near a city, most of the kids probably have seen and used cell phones - maybe even some smart phones.\r\n\r\nOTOH, the basic story sounds believable either way.  There's a lot of smart kids out in the world, but it's hard to tell because of the circumstances they're in.   Also, often times, we don't recognize intelligence in other people if it manifests in a way that is unfamiliar with us.  But  ability to hack phones, e.g., that's something we in the west can appreciate (well, some of us).\r\n\r\nHonk if ya've ever bricked yer droid!

Keep in mind one thing. The ring that Obama has worn since 1981 is a Muslim ring. The inscription states " THERE IS NO GOD EXCEPT ALLAH" Even when he was married he kept the ring on,it is not a wedding ring. The ring and its engraving have been verified,thanks to new close up photos. There is a choice for Christians, and yes I agree with Huckabee. You can keep this great country out of the hands of Muslims, who never ever fought for this country, or you can let it become Socialistic and wipe away all of the greatness of the United Staes and the wars fought for freedom. Or you can sit back and do nothing and yes, in the end you will pay for your non-action.Remember when Obama ran the first time he said NO taxpayer dollars go to abortion. What a lie, as Planned Parenthood is the biggest receiver of your tax dollars and thats what they do, even partial birth abortion. Lie after lie and even not the Bengasi killings he claims to know nothing. Our children and grandchildren future is mortgaged with the largest deficit ever and climbing. Yes, you can only blame yourself if you don't vote

Most of the fifty-five Founding Fathers who worked on the Constitution were members of orthodox Christian churches and many were even evangelical Christians. The first official act in the First Continental Congress was to open in Christian prayer, which ended in these words: "...the merits of Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Savior. Amen". Sounds Christian to me.  \r\nBen Franklin, at the Constitutional Convention, said: "...God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice is it probable that an empire can rise without His aid?"  \r\nJohn Adams stated so eloquently during this period of time that; "The general principles on which the fathers achieved Independence were ... the general principles of Christianity ... I will avow that I then believed, and now believe, that the general principles of Christianity are as etemal and immutable as the existence and attributes of God."  \r\nLater, John Quincy Adams answered the question as to why, next to Christmas, was the Fourth of July this most joyous and venerated day in the United States. He answered: "...Is it not that the Declaration of Independence first organized the social compact on the foundation of the Redeemer’s mission upon earth? That it laid the cornerstone of human government upon the first precepts of Christianity?" Sounds like the founding of a Christian nation to me. John Quincy Adams went on to say that the biggest victory won in the American Revolution was that Christian principles and civil government would be tied together In what he called an "indissoluble" bond. The Founding Fathers understood that religion was inextricably part of our nation and government. The practice of the Christian religion in our government was not only welcomed but encouraged.  \r\nThe intent of the First Amendment was well understood during the founding of our country. The First Amendment was not to keep religion out of government. It was to keep Government from establishing a 'National Denomination" (like the Church of England). As early as 1799 a court declared: "By our form of government the Christian religion is the established religion; and all sects and denominations of Christians are placed on the same equal footing." Even in the letter that Thomas Jefferson wrote to the Baptists of Danbury Connecticut (from which we derive the term "separation of Church and State") he made it quite clear that the wall of separation was to insure that Government would never interfere with religious activities because religious freedom came from God, not from Government.  \r\nEven George Washington who certainly knew the intent of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, since he presided over their formation, said in his "Farewell Address": "Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to subvert these great pillars." Sure doesn't sound like Washington was trying to separate religion and politics.  \r\nJohn Jay, the first Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, and one of the three men most responsible for the writing of the Constitution declared:  \r\n"Providence has given to our people the choice of their rulers, and it is their duty-as well as privilege and interest- of our Christian nation to select and prefer Christians for their rulers." Still sounds like the Founding Fathers knew this was a Christian nation.   (comes from:  afn.org)

Loved the Star Wars movies, all of them and have no criticism, but then again I am not a geek, freak, nerd, etc that studies every scene and book. I enjoy them for the action and story as all movies should be. However since Disney has mutilated and destroyed so many stories the next Star Wars film should be titled "Death of the Empire". George should have sold Disney the rights for making animated series, merchandising etc, and added a clause to not make a feature live action film ever. I believe this will be a decision he regrets as soon as the first film comes out.

WHAT THE ****? With Disney in full control Episodes 7, 8, & 9 & then a new one every 2 to 3 years? I tell ya it won’t be the same! The storyline is going to get deluded & stupid. Expect even more CGI & unless they perfect the art the movies will look cartoonish. Hell this includes the Indiana Jones saga as well! Indy will meet the same doom. The only good that could come out of this is more Star Wars & Indy rides at Disney parks. I rest my case!

YES,  He is absolutely correct in making this decision now. Sandy devastated our State.  It would be selfish of us to complain.  Halloween is not a religious holiday but a fun one for kids and adults. We can put aside the "Fun" for a  while until all of New Jersey has power, and the wreckage clear from our streets. New Jerseyans are not selfish.

NO! PRESIDENT OBAMA DID NOT ACT TOO FAST.  If he had not of responded as swiftly as he did “BIGOTS” like Brown would have something negative to say about the president, saying that he did not act fast enough?  It is President Obama’s obligations to do what is morally right to help people who need help.  One should not put a time limit on helping people who have lost all of what they own and even some lost their lives due to combinations of circumstances that are out of their control.  BROWN NEEDS TO RESIGN HIS POSITION OR BE FIRED.

My advice to most folks is-----forget FEMA. Have enough insurance on what you own to replace what you lost and you needn't worry about the feds for anything. When Bertha hit NC, I had a $3,000 loss. A tree fell on my heat pump. They said take pictures. I came in, showed them the pictures, and walked out with a $3,000 check in hand. What most folks don't realize is that with this kind of damage the repair folks get backed up big time. Even at their best, it's months before they can get to you. You may be one of thousands waiting on repairs. Sure, they'll do the best they can, but there's only so many hands to get things done.
1
So if we are to go back to what you believe shaped this nation...we need to go back to labor exploitation and land barons.  It was and is greed that is driving this nation right now and almost brought it to its knees....we need to go back to this???\r\nThe bible speaks about those who act like they are saved or have morals but Jesus said their HEARTS are far from Him.  Not everyone who says Lord, Lord shall be saved.

Romney stood with Paul Ryan and wanted to stop the last FEMA funding when the last big hurricane slammed the East Coast two years ago.....House Republicans wanted to cut programs and litigate before allowing relief aid to get to the states!\r\n \r\nThis is the hallmark of a Republican's idea of letting the problems fix themselves that Brownie perfected with the Katrina hurricane and his utter failure to respond, while blocking water supplies to get to the stranded folks, while they were on roofs, begging for help...\r\n \r\nRomney endorses taking FEMA funds, splitting them 50 ways, and giving them to the states. If a state devastation is bigger than the funds the state given, Romney would use his sharpie and put an "X" where the state used to be. Problem solved!

In 2010 we had a fierce hail stone storm. Our roof sustained damage. We purchased the home brand new in 2009. The roof has a 50 year wear and tear warranty (Cement tiles).\r\nThe damage was covered however we had a twelve percent age deduction. Tried repeatedly to have someone in the company explain how in one year a 50 year roof lost twelve percent of value. You ready for this, I was told "that is how we figured it". Being a smart a** I purchased a cheap calculator and sent it to the claims department. The adjuster could not understand the math.

Rush Limbaugh is a crass, egomaniacal, blowhard.  When Obama won the presidency four years ago, Limbaugh actually hoped and prayed that it would be a failure..

Obama is Muslim. He admitted this in many speeches. Look up the video evidence for yourselves. Out of Obama's own mouth he told the Muslim world America is no longer Christian that we're a Muslim faith, I am one of you, & we're better off for it. He went on to make fun of the bible, the Sermon on the Mount & how we don't read our bibles. Maybe this is why he blamed a video for Benghazi because it insulted Mohammed. I don't get how the media & press are shielding Obama in an unethical way. They're to report the news. Now they endorse their candidate & say such obnoxious things. I'm sick of it all.

OK, where are ya NOW???  Read about election issues, all the Willards on here are ALWAYS out to slam Obama, how do you like us NOW??? \r\nYou all are just a bunch of azzholes.  When it comes to lies, you're all here supporting Willard. When it comes to one of THE worst ideas by far that comes outta his mouth, you're NOT here to defend him. \r\nGuess we'll see what ya got tomorrow, right???

I am looking at all the places that get hit by hurricanes and disasters and wondering why Mitt would ever care about these large liberal areas. Heck take out all those areas and give them nothing that way they can bring his rich neighborhoods into all these Democratic areas. Then he can send the Liberals to cuba or some other country so him and Rush and Hannity can do with this country like they want. Give me a break. If we give these guys another chance to ruin this country right now then shame on us.

Jobs WAS apple, it's success was pinned to one man. Its success was pinned to being the best of the best. No prudent business ties their hopes to only hitting home runs... to hit it out of the park, again and again is not feasible... their balloon has to be deflated, and brought down to reality. \r\n  \r\nApple will not continue  in its leadership position. There are too many hungry competitors out there...

To quote you before you delete it.\r\n\r\n"Dont take this wrong but you seem to have become his biggest fan, he says something nasty about me or popa g and you laugh and join in."\r\n\r\nI have seen Maggie's posts and her comments to me are no different to most anyone else. Your panties are in a twist because she is tiring of you ways. She has done nothing but question your actions. You throw out I thought we were friends followed by vile remarks.\r\n\r\nI have read you defending RT stating you can't understand why so many people are against him, same as Popa G.\r\n\r\nI also said Deemed in his true form. I know he's trolling. He's a lifer. He's not going anywhere, but has to reinvent himself when called out for his Bigot ways. Good guy to call a friend RTP. Shows your level of worth.\r\n\r\nAgain I don't get your boner for MP other than you cannot let him be forgotten.\r\n\r\nYou shame the name Roland - you are not a man of honor, but a coward who jabs, runs, deletes, hides and plays the victim.

Oloser's boy to go..................  ​ ....... The Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Wednesday shows Mitt Romney attracting support from 49% of voters nationwide, while President Obama earns the vote from 47%.

He has enjoyed a three- or four-point edge on each of those days.

Romney spells bad news for America if this slippery eel attains the White House.  He wants to privatize everything  he can get his hands on which includes education, the Post Office, Social Security, FEMA, other government agencies.  This jerk does not represent people of this country. He will sell us out to China like he did when he operated companies at Bain Capital.  He is all for big business, the billionaires like himself, the 1 percenters.  He lacks conviction, focus, is not a visionary as we have seen when he worked at Bain.  He will take away workers rights, abolish unions, drastically reduce state aid that will affect police, fire, teachers, and state budgets.  Romney was a lousy Governor and used Massachusetts as a stepping stone to higher office.  He spent more time out of state building his platform for the Presidency than managing the state.  He wants to repeal Obamacare and yet it was the same plan he had for Massachusetts.  Romney will keep The Industrial Military Complex happy when he starts World War III with Iran.  Women will be upset with him when he appoints Justices to The Supreme Court who will be instrumental in over turning Roe vs. Wade.  Romney was a ruthless corporate raider and it is corporate greed along with reckless governing by George W.  that has put this country into the abyss that we are slowly crawling out of and moving in the right direction.

More socialist nonsense....   End all subsidies and all corporate TAXES.   Who pays those taxes anyways?   I will tell you stupid liberals....  The CUSTOMERS do.  Corporate taxes are nothing more than hidden sales taxes...  Chicago, ire, Obamaville to you socialists, has a 11.5% sales tax.  Add in the hidden slaes taxes on everything you buy and is there any wonder Chicago has the smallest percentage of middle class anywhere in America? \r\n You liberals are really stupid....  You think Exxon will not raise the price at the pump top pay any and all taxes?   Name one corporation that ever sent a tax bill to its shareholders...   Can you say economically clueless?

Strategically, it's a good maneuver.  He gets to campaign in a battleground while not ignoring the crisis.  NJ and NYC are lost causes as far as the campaign is concerned, and he couldn't' do anything there anyway.  Why not take the opportunity to run a charity drive and associate "caring" with "Romney."

If I were president I would just do it. That is a lot of $ for a charity. I would hold him to the offer.

"I think people have forgotten that we are all Americans and that we are a team"\r\n\r\n1 in 6 here in Michigan rely on Food Stamps. Our Governor just spent a ridiculous amount of state dollars mudslinging his Canadian Bridge proposal against the man who owns the existing bridge. Detroit is on the brink and millions here remain unemployed and blockaded from the workforce.\r\n\r\nBUT... volunteers are filling 5-gallon plastic buckets full of donated supplies and are donating cash to get these things to New Yorkers tonight and tomorrow. Hurricane Sandy continues to pelt us and our winds remain over 40 MPH. Has ANYONE heard from Congress? The President has already alerted our area for potential disaster assistance. Has ANYONE, anyone at all... heard from Congress? or Romney? Didn't he claim to have lived here? TEAM- The Everyday Average Man... but NEVER the Republican. Remember THAT on Election Day.

The prez did this a a publicity act. He failed to react to the enghazi attack but is worried aout the hurricane. He isn't worried about anyone. He is pissed because he isn't campaigning. I'm not an Obama fan and never will be but if he visited the NJ shore good for him but it still doesn't change my mind about him.

Click on this link below.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow the link to video showing Romney bold faced lying telling people Jeep and Chrysler are moving jobs to China. This is another case of Romney lying to people who dont know better. This is what he does. He lies out and out with no conscience. What kind of man would that be to put in the White House? What a sad state our politics are in when a guy like this can fool so many people.\r\n\r\n\r\nGet online and let everyone know how you feel. Campaign for Obama on these posts! Dont let Mitt get away with his cheating ways. Lets hold him accountable!!!!! Its up to us!!!\r\nIgnore these idiots who dont care and just espouse hate on these posts. Don't waste your time responding to them. They are hopeless. Target your comments to those who express a desire to learn more, the undecideds. Direct your posts to them. They are the people we care about.\r\nThose other hate mongers who love Romney are lost souls and lost causes. Dont let them draw you into wasting your time responding to them. Look for undecideds and people who write something that indicates they are not sure. Respond to 'their' posts directly and make your case for Obama!\r\n\r\n\r\nNext Tuesday night we will have plenty of time to tell the Romney lovers that we told them so!!!!!!

Crypto is not cheap and it slows the transmissions due to added encryption.  Ground based gear can be allowed to be in the clear if the proximity to enemy interception is not a worry.  The rule is to keep it simple and if the enemy is close enough to detect it, they are close enough to kill.   \r\n \r\nThis article is now more a breach than mentioning what state NSA is in.

Slowly they are taking away the citizens right to film the police while they give the police the right to film citizens freely without any discourse.\r\nWhy complain about it?

In my opinion, Sandy will change the Conversation in this country like NO STORM ever has before, even Katrina...New Orleans didn't count to many,  NYC, NJ does.....The Storm hit the right place in this country to AFFECT CHANGE....... \r\n If Sandy has any pluses it's the wake-up call that will NOW be realized on Global Warming, our inferior outdated infrastructure and the Need for Future planning and Green technology.......New  ​  York, New Jersey will have to come up with a plan like Amsterdam to protect their Infrastructure ......This Storm will spur the needed conversation and  investment in OUR FUTURE...... I see a LOT OF GOOD COMING FROM THIS DISASTER........The WAKE-UP CALL - SANDY

To DieHardCentrist: If you interpreted my first remark in my posting as saying that audiences don't know what a good movie is, I can see how you missed my point. "My bad", as some would say; I phrased it poorly. Truth is, I agree with what you said in response. Making a judgement about any movie, book, song, or other work of art is, by all means, a very individual thing, a matter of personal taste & opinion. What I was really trying to get at is that, just because there was a poor turnout at this movie's first showing, or some segment of the audience didn't care for it, that doesn't automatically mean that it isn't worthwhile to others. Most of all, I'm saying that I personally won't pass judgement on it until I've seen it myself. As for the other comments I've seen on this topic, those which disparage any given performer in the film just for being in it reveal more about the person making the comment than about the movie or the performer. For instance, the person who stated "[Hanks] hasn't done anything good since Forrest Gump" evidently either didn't like "Appollo 13", "The Green Mile", or "Catch Me If You Can", OR maybe didn't see those movies. For that person to also say "His career has been over for years, somebody needs to tell him" just indicates that they probably prejudged "Cloud Atlas" simply because Hanks is in it. I'm not the biggest fan of Tom Hanks myself, but I considered those other 3 films as worth watching, so I give him credit for the roles he played in each of them, and won't be put off from seeing "Cloud Atlas" because of somebody else's opinion that he's a 'has-been'.

To funny as Chris Christie is being interviewed by fox. The question was asked would you allow Romney to tour NJ with you. Just before Christie could answer you could see just under Christie the announcement that Romney would be touring Sandy with Christie.  \r\n  \r\nThe funnyt part is Christe answered by saying   I have no idea, nor am I the least bit concerned or interested,” he said. “I’ve got a job to do here in New Jersey that’s much bigger than Presidential politics, and I could care less about any of that stuff.”

I think that all the star war movies (1-6) where all good and without even one of them the others would not have been the same. Now granted 1-3 will always be the originals and will always be the best, but what George did with the cgi in 1-3 was part of his original plan he just didn't have the technology and people need to leave him alone. People f***ing with him is the whole reason Disney Know owns lucasfilm, and we are going to be stuck with s**t.

NO!!!!!!! Rules are rules, follow them or stay out. Hand cuffing is to prevent physical outbursts as well as to protect the public and officers involved. In all likelyhood she has no issue wearing cuffs at home for fun. All to often the Police allow situations to get out of hand before cuffing, this was textbook perfect. The best way to stop a problem is to end it before it starts. Don't like the rules in America? Youi have the freedom to leave, I am sure China or Iran would welcome you with open arms.

For the second time, Sabrina gets the ultimate shaft from the voters. I was not able to see most of her dance, because of a locked picture, probably due to poor satellite transmission.

Romney gypsies in the US and also in the UK. Romney's grandfather had 5 wives. No body ever talks about that. Gypsies and multi-wives trumps any story there is about Kenya. And remember Donald trump was also born with a silver spoon in his mouth. The  arrogance these guys have is ridiculous.  \r\n SOMEONE wrote someone will actually believe it.  Someone- you need to get your facts straight about Romney. His documented history begins in the UK as a bunch of gypsies. He even looks like the ones that live here.

Major Tom,\r\nWhat do you think? Is President Obama a christian?

If your president has nothing to hide, he should cough up the documents.  Otherwise, he's just hurting charities by not having an easy $5M donation.  True, Trump is an egomaniac, but what's the harm for the benefit of charity.

Which is neither one~ Insanity - doing the same thing over and over but expecting different results~ Albert EInstein\r\n \r\nAnd main problem is people have been given so many half truths by false and weak leaders from either side they wouldnt know the real truth if it were stamped on their foreheads~ So what we have is not a Republic not a Democracy although, Americans hear that word often~ American people have an oligarchy ruled by a handful or so of elite bankers controlled through Wallstreet which is controlled by British Empire; through big banks of London~ Article 4 section 4 The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion [such s that of communism socialism democracy oligarchy]; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence. \r\n \r\n"Hence it is that such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths." James Madison\r\n \r\nSo premoting Democracy even though what Americans really have is an oligarchy is both dyslexic and inept~\r\n \r\nLast there is not even supposed to be a two party system~ So true Christians will stay home and pray and not vote for insanity because only people in their right minds know this truth which there are some and enough to infest the thought of such into others~ Solution: A true patriot will go against the grain to gain and not go along to get along like Peter Pan or Tinker Bell~ And this is exactly what I am doing through the military~ Elites put of the two faces in front not We The People~ So voting for either is just voting for the same of what all already have~ And that is insane~ Something will give watch~! Petty issues mean nothing in accordance to an overall sham and power hungry leaders who dont have solutions to offer only problems~ As part of the Divide and Conquer method American people are being lead down a road of destruction no matter who it is in office~ Because the faces in the front may change but the true agenda and oligarchy dont unless, the American people make it happen~ I am voting for Albert E. So if you vote wear the spiritual mark and wear it well~ Because I dont force people to be saved~ If they dont care to be they WON'T~ Antonius Shad AKA The Light

Dear Friends: \r\nThe hurricane Sandy is one heck of a disaster.  There are nothing but cute little dogs, puppies and kitties as well as human babies that are without heat and food and no power.   Manufacturers of pet foods  and  baby formula for all types of animals and  real human babies,  donations and advise on what to donate and how to help.  \r\n  \r\nRemember some drown they cannot swim in the moving forces of water.   \r\n  \r\nAlso among them are those that are humans that are blind, deaf, disabled and amputees.  \r\n  \r\nLittle birds could be let lose, but if they are not accustomed to the cold and no food would starve.  \r\n  \r\nSome are living in their cars with no food, no water and no power.   Some as the news has put out are just born or being born.    Any orphans among them.    If they cannot afford or do not want their human babies  or their puppies and kitties  please where should they go?  Where can they take them in all the regions of the impact of Sandy and all other storms.   \r\n  \r\n  \r\nGod Bless.   Amen.    \r\n  \r\nPresident Obama and Vice President Biden thank you for all you have done in the wake of this monstrous storm.        \r\nAlso thank you to all the other Government members,  their staff,   volunteers, power workers,  police force,  military assisting and firemen and woman,  ambulance drivers and each and every other who have helped.   Thank you to the Red Cross and Salvation Army!    Thank you for all who have made donations .      \r\n  \r\nShortly other storms and tornados and snow will follow.  \r\n  \r\nTheives and thugs,  of all types including those ripping them off during this disaster in the home improvement area and materials hit them hard.    I think there should be no leniency or three time law like California.  Forget it , they should get the highest penalties possible.     \r\n  \r\nGod Be with you all.           Amen

ESCUSE me: but if you know not FACT: how can you comment?\r\nPerhaps, yu should educate yourself.\r\n  There is a vast difference between a real Christian and not those who have to tell you what they are and a MUSLIM--look it up.\r\n  And if you do not know then please do NOT VOTE: Ignorance kills.\r\n  Apparently, you do not read or you would have READ his books "if the winds should shift I will go with the Muslims!"\r\n  And Apparently you have no religion or beliefs nor do you keep up with daily changes in our nation:  How about NATIONAL PRAYER DAY--cancelled.\r\n  But invites went to the MUSLIM WORLD White House Direct: 57,000 MUSLIMs had their new National Muslim Prayer Day...\r\n  Why not visit WDC where blacks sleep on park benches while Muslims arrived in Limos to the White House...get a grip.\r\n  If you sit on USA soil safe for now: and know not what is going on..you have put me and others in jeopardy...and have no clue.\r\n  If you do not pay attention to reality: what is important to you?\r\n  How about who supports this Muslim: Castro's Cuba, Putin of the former USSR of which he would like to return all the nations to it; then we have the one who admires what he has done unto the USA none other than HUGO CHAVEZ; perhaps you should look up what they have done unto their nations and what they stand for becaue they love what this Muslim has done unto us as One Nation Under GOD\r\n  Foreign aid up 80% US Border Security down 78%...\r\n  THREE nations toppled with US deficits to bankruptcy...amazing  ​  is it not!\r\n  Egypt, Syria, Libya: all for the Black Muslim Brotherhood to institute SHARIA LAW...I worked with foreign students...I get it direct from them and know about their dead families and friends while ignorance prevails as to how they were toppled...see the media lies..\r\n  Look at what Hitler did: READ...your ignorance brings joy to the Communist and to the world that loves to exist to hate the USA of those who do good...\r\n  You have taken each and every life for granted whom has provided you their lives for your freedoms...diminishi  ​ ng...and you bathe is total absolute factless existence.\r\n Do Unto Others As You WOuld Have Them Do Unto YOU

What the devil is on this boneheads mind. We all knew from the storm passing through Cuba it was going to come inland somewhere on the East Coast. Florida to the Carolinas were told to prepare. Thankfully they got a brushing and not the full force. Then it kept heading North however more towards land and then it started it's West Northwest track. All the computer models said it would track from the South Jersey coast to New York and continue inland to the Ohio valley. Lake Erie and Michigan were flowing over their banks and flooding. Jersey and NY were being pounded, blizzards to the Southwest of Jersey, fires, floods wind and deaths and the President was premature? Even New Jersey Governor Christie publically thanked the President for his quick response and told the public the President said "if you need anything more, call ME immediately". Brownie, maybe you should have drowned with the over 1000 citizens that did not make it in New Orleans.

Legalizing pot won't change anything. Kids who want it will still get it and kids that want to stay away from it will still stay away from it.

Staying away from the virus will work? No way! ...... Getting the flu shot saves lives. People die from Influenza. It's funny how many people are uneducated on the subject and how the immune system works, and how stubborn they are towards getting the flu shot.

I have to disagree somewhat with you Someone. Two perfect examples that Ford has not improved their quality, as JD Powers has stated: I just purchased a Super Duty E-450 and it went back to dealership with an oil leak two days after delivery and a co worker recently purchased the new Explorer and it went in for service in less than two weeks after delivery.\r\n  I will agree that the gap has been narrowed a bit, but not a bunch. Manufacturers are making claims that they have increased their quality but thus far no car rating organizations have backed that up. \r\n  I continue to purchase Fords, GM's  and Toyota's for our company and the facts are that the domestics need more service. In fact, we have not worked on a single Toyota product in our fleet except for routine maintenance. The ONLY reason that I purchase the Fords and GM's is because they offer some products that fill a niche for us that isn't offered by Toyota.\r\n  I hope that domestics really do increase their quality someday because they have some very nice products to offer but the quality falls short.

Say whatever you want about bush but  In 2010 after he was no longer president after the fort hood incident Bush went immediately to fort hood to be with the soldiers and their families.  He did no press conference and the media was not alerted in any way.  The only way anyone knew about it is because one of the wives of the injured men took a picture of him in the hospital room with her husband.  There were no security gaurds or secret service.  3 days later, Nobama shows up for a photo op and supports noone. and two years later the people who were involved cannot get benefits or purple hearts because your sorry **** president won't call this incident terrorism.  If you were such a poitical nerd you would know all this.  Maybe Bush isn't a political tool for the right the way that clinton is for the left. Did you ever consider that?

Hmm, Slavery has been around forever. The idea of slavery is in the Bible and is exactly what happened to people who went bankrupt. They were palced  place into servatude and in the seventh year their debt had to be forgiven if they had not worked it off yet. As far as the USA, yes we had slavery but it was not the driving force that built up this nation. In fact Latin America had a far greater slavery problem and in greater numbers then its northern cousin. Check your history books to see how sugar and gold was harvested in the 1750's and then cotton in the 1800's. \r\n \r\nSo, A nation built on Evangelical Christain values end up finding slavery wrong and continues to prosper. Latin America was mainly bulit on Catholic Values and still uses a rate of pay similar to slave wages. I don't see a ton of people running off to live in central and latin America.

tether exactly my point,,,,, where in the Bible does it say mike huckabee, or ANY OTHER self-professed Christian  is the final arbiter of what is right and wrong giving him(them) opportunity to judge others on this or any other  issue? when Jesus said, "let he among you who is without sin cast the first stone," he didn't give special dispensation to ANYONE. it is quite true you now them by their fruit. it is also true their are many many self-professed Christians are like the clay pots of the pharasees, fine and pretty on the outside yet full of tainted putrid, political motivation on the inside. Jesus still Be weeping.only Jesus is he final arbiter.

This is a great time for Disney as a whole, Not only for Star Wars, but The Indiana series. We all love Harrison Ford but the next chapter should have him passing the "torch"  as it were, to His next in line. But "NOW Disney can really that Star Wars to a new level" And really put the Star Wars universe in The theme parks. My Love forever is and alwas has been "Disneyland" But finding room will be a might tough! But (bite my toung) Disney World is where the should Do a Theme park of it's own, like Harry Potter at Univesal Orlando, I mean they do hves a little extra space there ?! only time will tell.

One thing is for certain: If, by chance, obama is re-erected to his throne, let us pray that he does not die in office and Biden is president. Biden's idiocy will kill what is left after obama's destruction of America. FYI: Have you ever spell checked ..obama..? It corrects you with..osama. hmm.

Wow!!! Tabby ask yourself this question. Would you have wanted your parents to abort you before you were born. This isn't an attack on you at all. There is truths in your statment. However with out Christian values, every country has fallen when they have turned thier backs on God. This is a fact that if anyone does the homework, they will see it. Would you rather God be for you or God be against you?  I did however very much enjoy your commet.

" think it's pretty safe to say that most conservative and liberals alike are opposed to this kind of intrusion of personal rights." You really need to do some research. Seriously.\r\n \r\nRegarding your comments about Bush appointees to the courts, do some more research. Seriously.\r\n \r\nThe Roberts vote on health care reform was an anomaly, and you know it. The 5-4 right-wing activist majority has voted as a bloc on almost every single issue - and always against personal freedom and in favor of the right of government to intrude in your personal life - usually under the guise of "law enforcement."\r\n \r\nBTW - in case you missed it, Mutt wants to put Robert Bork on the Supreme Court. Check out that guys record, if you dare.....

This is why so many moderate and liberal people are beginning to think that conservatives and Republicans are "all a bunch of crazies." \r\n  \r\nI certainly don't think that "all" Republicans are crazy, but certainly the "Grand Old Party" is attracting a lot of fruit baskets these days. \r\n  \r\nIf a person disagrees with the President's handling of the economy or whatever, then fine, we as Americans are free to disagree, but when people start raving that God will send you to Hell for "not voting Republican," then they get downright scary. \r\n  \r\nThen they start going on and on about "rape" and "legitimate rape," etc.  When politicians start yelping that "they know what God wants" then you gotta start to worry.  Who are they to say they exclusively know how to interpret God's will?  If they get elected, will they impose a theocracy upon the American people?  Will they not only outlaw abortion, but also ban birth control?  Will they put gays in prison, for being gay?  Will they go as far as to repeal the Nineteenth Amendment, as some conservative Christians have a petition to do just that?  Will they keep their promise to do away with Medicare and Social Security, because it's "socialist?"  I dunno how far some of these right wing people will go...  it has me worried.  I'm a Christian but some of these "Christian politiicans" actually frighten me.

I agree with the principle.  18K FEMA folks is intolerable.  The infrastructure exists at the private and state level, but we need some entity which can oversee it all.  Crisis managers are necessary, and if you had not forgotten or are into wishful thinking again, its still the rule that the state systems are subordinate to the federal one. \r\n\r\nAll I am saying is a there is a necessity for one entity to do the coordinating.  Otherwise, you have multiple agencies competing and contesting with one another for scarce resources.  More order, less chaos....in a time of disaster that is what is needed most.

Be careful what you percieve as "made here", as many of the parts,{ electrical,fuel, upholstery ect) are made in some far flung locations. A lot of upholstery comes from spain & Portugal.

I agree that October may be  a bad month for investors. No good news with do nothing Congress but please explain this to me somebody. I have a question about race relations. The year is 2012. We have an intelligent black President. We have young white girls with black boyfriends. We have Pell grants, opportunity in the military, opportunity to attend community college or college, freedom to travel, freedom to start a business. We have hope. Just why is it that every time we have a natural disaster be it LA Riots, flooding of New Orleans, this Hurricane, you always see black faces looting, stealing and assaulting police officers? What does this say about 2012 and how far we still have to go before we are all on the same page and respecting one another? Religion seems to have failed. The GOP lost the drug war, failed to enforce our borders, failed to control the emergence of gangs and organized crime. What can we do to get the message across to those who would commit such crimes that we are tired of it all? Move forward.

No! In a situation such as Sandy,it is good to know that the President,and FEMA have a grasp of what lies a head. Governor Christie has been very outspoken with praise for President Obama and the way he is handling this crisis. If anyone would be critical of the President,it would be Christie. Obama is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't. It is very sad that right now the country should be together with hope,and help instead of nasty politics!

Such negativity.  Lets start off in defense of Disney.  Has anyone even SEEN the Marvel line of flims?  Great movies all the way around leading up to the Avengers, which was fantastic.  Tron, yet another great film.  John Carter, while not a "blockbuster" was quite entertaining and well done.  And seriously, after the "last" three films, those attrocities that introduced such characters as Jar Jar Binks....and people bitch about Disney "messing up" Star Wars.  Its already been destroyed.  \r\n \r\n"Star Wars was great. The implied ownership of it by fanboys was not. 40 year old men wearing Stormtrooper costumes has got to stop. Let the next-gen have it and don't backslide and mock when it goes different then you though. And remember this in 20 yrs they'll be remaking Twilight."  \r\n \r\nI highly doubt you'll see a remake of that horrible film.  In 20 years people will step back and say "i cannot believe I actually WATCHED" that crap.. (in reference to Twilight).  And as for whats happening, this is NOT a reboot of Star Wars.  It is not some new, reimagined Star Wars, its a continuation of the saga.  So, sorry to tell you, those 40 year old men will most likely be wearing their stormtrooper costumes into their 60's and 70's.  Hell, if they rebooted the series for the so called "next Gen" it would end about 10 minutes into the movie.  Luke would have gotten the droids, gotten the message from Leia and then said, "Oh well, its not about me, time to wipe their memories" and the credits would roll.

Newsflash on the healthcare issue - many of us are now facing paying penalties because with the passage of Obamacare we weren't able to pay the insane increases in cost. Our insurance went up 360%, so now we get to not only go without for another month until we can switch to get on with my husbands company, but may also be penalized for it. THAT does not "help the poor" in any way. The abortion issue is a hypocritical red herring - if anyone actually cared about it, they would also be focusing their attention on the thousands of children who are currently in state care awaiting a family. They would look at the base reasons why women get an abortion, and try to correct those situations. Abortion is a symptom of larger problems, and to just randomly ban it shows an ironic disregard for people all around.

Republicans have always tried to monopolize Christianity, as if Republicans are all good, honest Christians, and Democrats are all heathens. Mitt Romney is a Mormon, and like someone else mentioned, they venerate Joseph Smith when he was never much of a prophet. His greatest revelation was what? Men can have as many wives as they want? Ridiculous. It should be obvious to everyone what Huckabee is trying to do, but it's not; folks in the South don't realize Mike is using religion as a political tool. Sadly, it is a good strategy. I overhear my relatives talking about how Obama doesn't support Israel, and other propaganda they hear on "Crosstalk." Mitt Romney doesn't even care about half of this country (46%), so if he does support Israel, it's probably only 2% of the population. What do you think would happen if I were to tell my potential employers that I intend to do only half of my job, and that I don't care about the other half of the work? I probably wouldn't get the job...unless I happened to be running for President. Minorities don't make up 46% of the population either, so if you're not well off financially, you might want to consider that. As for the rich, we know Romney lied when he said he doesn't care about them. If he didn't he wouldn't be reinstating the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest 2% of Americans, when logic dictates that the middle class, the poor, and small upstart businesses should be the ones getting tax breaks. Republicans have sat on their hands since the last election, doing everything to oppose the Democratic party and shooting down every proposal. Now they say that the Obama administration hasn't made good on their promises, but most Americans don't know about the partisanship of Republicans which has stifled many attempts at reform. \r\nScare tactics to get people to vote; real smooth, Huckabee.

If any of the poor victims of this National disaster are thinking FEMA will give them any aid and comfort at their time of need they will be very dissapointed. The Feds take two thirds of every FEMA dollar to support their own beaucracy.  Trickle down is more apt an assessment for FEMA than anything Reagan created.   Just drop the federal checks in the accounts for the States and Municipalities, then th feds should get out of the way,  and then we will have something that more resembles Social Justice.

Many people need help but don't get it because they have to volunteer themselves to get it.  No one else can get help for them.  And all too often these people don't think they have a problem, they blame everyone else.  About all this mother can hope to do is bail and take her daughters with her.  Dad isn't going to volunteer for help even if he is thrown in jail for years.  That is a huge failure in this country and until we make some changes it will not get better.  Trained people knew about the loose screw in Tuscon and in Denver, yet no one did anything.  The old joke about psychiatrists is valid here.  How many psychatrists doe it take to chage a light bulb?  Only one provided the light bulb is willing to change.

Letting your car get flooded is just unacceptable...unles  ​ s you WANT it to get flooded.  Everyone knew about the storm days in advance.  If your car is in a low lying area, you MOVE it to higher ground, park it, and get back home one way or another.  ANYONE can find higher ground for their car within a 1 mile walk.  Insurance companies shouldn't have to pay out for sheer stupidity.

I'm not saying he's perfect, no president ever was so quit supporting Romney as if he's the greatest thing to ever grace the presidential ballot.

his obvious disdain for the entire east coast is appalling.  this is why nothing gets done on a national level.  this guy is xenophobic against his own countrymen.  i hope he doesn't have to accept money for any flooding or tornados, and then have some vermont representative say, "i hope they don't spend it on fried butter."  what a dick.

So much venom!  So little common sense!  Who people vote for is certainly their own business.  Huckabee, like any other US citizen, has the right to state his opinion and his preference for President.  Heard of, "Freedom of Speech?"  Without it you would not have the opportunity to spew your inept comments!  Nuff said!

It would seem that the bigger issue for Christians would  not be abortion or same sex marriage, which are biggies, but  should be who worships the true God, based on the Christian religion.  That is so important that God made that the very first commandment.  If Hucksbee is a Chrisitan minister I don't see how he can justify supporting someone who violates the first commandment,  So Obama  is not a perfect Christian, but based on Huckabees religion, he  would be the one to support.  I think something else is going on with Huckabees posiition.

This one I disagree with. Shows can always be better & funnier (as this one could), but it is more original & cutting edge than most everything else. I get the feeling it's a great show hindered by trying to stay in bounds. Still worth watching I think.

I agree with this order. With all the damage that was done, I would not want my kids running around in that.If Obama made a decision like this,he would be praised by most people,for thinking of peoples safety.This decision was made by a New Jersey Gov. I do not necessarily care for this man,but on this decision,I believe it was a good one.

Mr. Obama is a MUSLEM not a christain!   \r\nAs a Christian I feel the need to elaborate on the meaning by Mr. Huckabee: when voting or taking a stand on any situation as a Christian we are bound by biblical truths, it is no different when choosing a president. 1st: what is this man's position on biblical marriage? (man and woman as God created/ no gay marriage) 2nd: what is this man's position on the un-born children?( no abortion) and 3rd: What is this man's stance on Israel?. Everything else is politics, but these three main factors; we will answer to God for!

You show your lack of understanding with this post.  Obama DID let Detroit go bankrupt.  Romney wanted it to go bankrupt as well, but wanted the bankruptcy process to be handled by the banks, not by government money.   \r\n You use the word "bankrupt" as if it is synonymous with "out of business."  It isn't.  Perhaps you should take a finance class.  Romney never advocated letting the automobile industry go out of business.  If you think he did, post the actual source rather than your uneducated opinion based on incorrect assumptions. \r\n Both leaders thought that bankruptcy was the correct process, one with government money and the other with private sector money.  Automobiles are made by private sector companies - it seems appropriate that private sector banks should use their money to bail them out. \r\n The same is true with foreclosures - let the market follow its course.  Had we done that, we would be on the upward swing  of the housing mess instead of sitting here STILL waiting for housing prices to hit bottom.  Uncertainty levels are extraordinarily high, and a good portion of the reason is because we didn't let the housing market take care of itself.

Let me say first that I support Mr. Romney. I put more emphasis on leadership than denomination in elections, and Mr. Obama has shown precious little of that.\r\n \r\nHaving said that, I would say I do not see eye to eye, or anything close, with the doctrine of the Mormon church. Scripture tells us that we are not to add to, nor take away from, the Bible, the ONLY word of God. But we have the Book of Mormon being presented alongside the Bible by these folk.\r\n \r\nNow, they will say thats because Jesus, after ascending to Heaven, came back, to North America, and had ministry here. But scripture teaches us that Jesus said explicitly that he would not come back till he came back to get His church (Christians). \r\n \r\nFinally, Morman doctrine teaches that God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are three separate gods. But the scriptures teach that they are what we know as the Holy Trinity; God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, which Jesus said would be our comforter. \r\n \r\nAs to Joseph Smith, I wander where his 'golden tablets' went? As far as I know, nobody BUT him ever saw them. Give me the Bible any day. God does not make mistakes. Man does. And Joseph Smith, however well intentioned he was, WAS, after all, a man...just another voice...

Wussy show in DC last night, post-Sandy, was really good, though not as transcendent as the Merc Lounge show.  For this band, a good mix really makes a huge difference -- especially with the vocals -- and they didn't have it last night.  (When they make the big time, first order of business:  Be able to afford to hire their own soundboard whiz.)  Plus, Chuck's amp was distractingly on the fritz (apparently he's been burning through them on this tour); and Mark can't join for this leg of the tour because of his teaching duties (Sundresses guitarist Brad Schnittger ably filled in, reportedly after spending the drive from Minneapolis to DC listening to Wussy discs!).  Even still, a wonderful set (see list below).  If you're in North Carolina, Athens, Nashville, New Orleans, Houston, Little Rock or St. Louis over the next ten days, don't miss it.\r\n\r\nAccording to Chuck, they've already started cutting demos for the next LP, which they plan to record soon after this tour ends.  \r\n\r\nFWIW, headliner Heartless Bastards -- with a much, much larger following, and 90 minutes of stage time compared to Wussy's 45 -- was not my cup of tea.  Anyone here a devotee?\r\n\r\nWussy setlist:\r\n\r\nAirborne\r\nHappiness Bleeds\r\nMaglite\r\nMountain of Tires\r\nBreakfast in Bed\r\nDeath by Misadventure\r\nPizza King\r\nPulverized\r\nMuscle Cars\r\nYellow Cotton Dress\r\nRigor Mortis

Name one thing Obama has accomplished while in office. Let me see: the economy is worse, we are still at war, there are more Muslim terrorists inside our country than ever, our embassies are under fire in all the Muslim countries, our soldiers are still at war. Oh, yes, then there is Obamacare which is going to cost me so much that I probably will not even have insurance unless I go on welfare and get free medical as needed. Oh, but I can't do that, there will be no more welfare because the country is in so much debt and taxes have to be raised to pay for that. Our country's credit rating is so low we probably can't borrow any more. Since everyone will now have to go on welfare, who is going to pay the taxes to cover all of the citizens and illegals that live here. My mind is boggled just thinking about it.

We vote for who will run the country best, not their moral issues. When it comes right down to it just  because a politician wins an election purely on moral issues, does not mean that is what is best for the country. Here is my thought. God gives us free will on the choices we make whether it be "gay" issues or "abortion" issues. We all make choices that we have to answer to God to eventually. It is not the governments job to have a say in every single aspect of our lives. We answer to God for those things. Bush was voted in soley for his "moral issues" and of course, because of his very rich financial backers but look what shape the country was in when he left office. Trying to "guilt" Christians into helping the rich is not a good idea. It has never worked in the past and it won't work now. I am one of the "47" percent Romney talked about behind closed doors when some genious recorded him actually telling the truth for a change. His moral issues don't mean squat. That is between him and God!

CALLING ON ALL AMERICANS FOR SUPPORT... of the Great American Reconciliation. Who has our money? Why and how did they get it? What role do law firms, alumni relationships, networks and groups have to do with it? It's no secret that we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in 2014. I can't imagine a more appropriate time to have our currency and all those who touch it... fully reconciled and working full power in our favor. It seems to me that there are an awful lot of administrators in high places not necessarily in our government, that have as much or more power and influence as our government. That's not a good Civil Right because We the People don't vote them in or out and there is no regulatory and supervisory oversight. I'm a father who wants to see America give his kids a fair and equal chance without two classes or an upper and lower distinction of the masses. I don't want to wait until 2014 to suddenly draw focus to Civil Rights. That Act passed FIFTY years ago. It shouldn't be illuminated for celebration, it should be celebrated as the normal everyday. \r\n\r\nI need your help. I support Civil Rights, not a New World Order. How about you?

Here Jonah, maybe I can help. I WONT call you a mean-spirited individual or anything of the sort. HOWEVER, this was forty years ago that scientists were saying this.  In case you are unfamiliar with the nature of science, the way we describe it and what we know about it is indefinitely changing.  It was only in the early twentieth century that we discovered particles smaller than atoms. And only in 1958 did we discover that DNA was responsible for heredity.  Science has been wrong many times and what we know about it has been disproven or changed over the years. So, your statement that says because forty years ago homosexuality was a choice that it must be the same today is null and void.  Science believed it was a choice but now it knows better.  If you wish for more evidence about whether science makes mistakes or not check here:

Did anyone catch why Harding set aside that oil reserve? \r\n  \r\nBottom line is that we cannot, in intelligent strategy, simply start pumping all of our oil out of the ground.    \r\n  \r\nWhat happens when our great-grandchildren have to go to war to get oil because we used all of ours up so we could have cheap gas for 10 years?

It takes out all possibility that ANYONE could be a Jedi, which is what drew a lot of the audience to the series. \r\n \r\nthe Bobba Fett thing...I know clones supposedly came from Jango, but Jango wasn't even thought of back in 77', therefore he is really the clone, from a certain point of view (as Obi Wan would say) lol.\r\n \r\nand when I said they wen't Frankenstein on Vader, I didn't mean how he was made more machine....I meant the whole "Noooooooooooooooooo  ​ ooooooooooooooooo" thing. It could have been written to be so much more original and interesting than that.

I am sure many of you have seen the ads run by the "anti socialist" db thomas petterffy all over the networks.... \r\n So this anti govt spendinig capitalist wrote an open letter asking that the US TREASURY PAYS the first $250 of every mortgage in order to keep the mortgage bond market intact..... \r\n No mention of the fact that his company is a massive bond trader and he was also buying MF global shares at pennies on the dollar last year !! \r\n If this is the type of honesty and integrity you want for America vote Romney .......if not hold your hate for 4 years and vote for Christie over Hilary.......

No! Everyone against Mr. Obama is putting his decisions under a microscope...how sad. If he waited to respond to Sandy, how many additional lives or property (NO FEMA SETUP) would we have lost. \r\n  \r\nMove FORWARD Mr. Obama and let the naysayers say what they like.

I think he's probably correct.  There is abuse of funds all over this country.  I think people are able to take care of their own (families & friends helping their own).  Allow them to do this and they use their own money wisely.  Most people do not spend other people's money wisely.  It's free, "easy" money!  Hopefully, east coast residents will be smarter and more honest than the victims of Katrina.  New Orleans is a notoriously liberal, mooching city that expected our govt. to bail them out of their crisis.  Not long after Katrina, the Texas coast suffered a devastating hurricane.  But you didn't hear them demanding money from the U.S. govt..  Instead, they continued their offerings of food & shelter to the Katrina victims, as though nothing had happened.

Yes, in some areas. Other areas in the state that have not been hit hard should have halloween a day or two later than wednesday night. The governor is a straight shooter. He is just looking out for the kids safety.

Nobody should feel like they have to vote on moral issues. God gave everyone free will to live their lives and answer to Him if they don't use the Bible as a guideline. Bush got voted in because of moral issues and because he had rich supporters but where did that leave our country. We are judged by God in areas that is no business of the Govenment. I am one of the 47 percent of the people that Romney talked about (truthfully for a change) behind closed doors. I think everyone should have gotten that message loud and clear. I am sorry but I voted for a Christian man so I know I can't go wrong. I don't know much about Mormans and it really is not even an issue with me, but I cannot vote for someone that has not told the truth since day one. If that is what a morman is, I am all that much more glad I am a Christian and voted for a Christian.

The writer definitely has too much time on his hands - researching stats that affect a very small portion of the population.  Leave the decision of whether the community should or should not celebrate to them based on their circumstances.  As to Halloween business if there is a want there will be someone out there to capitalize on it.  If you don't like the commericialization, then your best defense is not to buy the product - if enough do so, the business will dry up and Halloween will return to what it once was - communities getting together to share with one another.

I believe Mr. Brown owes President Obama a formal apology.  This storm was unprecedented in magnitude and came ashore in the most densely populated area of  North America.   \r\n While our hearts go out to families and friends who have lost loved ones, it should be noted that the loss of life for this storm was incredibly low.  I believe this [loss of lives] is the direct result of pro-active decisions by President Obama and his team, who showed us this week that his leadership skills are what the American people have been looking for.  Does Mr. Brown have that type of history?  I think not; What was the death toll in New Orleans? \r\n I do wish Mr. Brown and Mr. Romney would stop playing politics with people during extreme crisises....these are real people and real lives; not statistical results from a poll. \r\n And kudos to Chris Cristy, last night he showed he can be a stand-up guy with his praise of President Obama's efforts to provide help to the citizens who lived through Sandy.

The first logical place would be the commodities exchange in Chicago. But they had sleet/snow effects coming off of Lake Michigan. Still the infrastructure exist but could the people who work a the stock exchange even get there? The North East is the most densely populated area of America. What your advocating would take years to develop & at what cost ? Too much risk vs. the reward you might get. In the coming day's, I think were going to be amazed at how fast New York & New Jersey get back on their feet.

MSN's story caption reads "Pennsylvania goes dry after Sandy leaves it WET" which was a word combo that was as far from funny as you can GET, and if I were a gambling man I would wager that most of you feel the same way I BET, because there is nothing funny about a storm that has already taken several human lives, and left many animals needing medical attention from a VET, and even though some people feel that it is winding down the storm is not over but still poses a very dangerous THREAT to everything in the storm's general vicinity, including all of the people and their household PET, and when it comes to animals being hurt it is sad because they think that they are being punished for the last living room movie night fart that they LET, or for inconspicuously chewing a dozen holes in the children's trampoline safety NET, but even though you know that neither of these are the reason why, you should still allow them to FRET, because this will mold your animal with discipline, and leave you happy that it and Sandy MET, but as for all of the other damage Sandy has done, and is doing, I see many more problems than an alcohol shortage, including a  country with a whole lot more DEBT....Let’s hope that Sandy will soon STOP, and everything will go back to being as joyous as the Hibbity, Dibbity, BOP, and a Pee, Pie, Po, POP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Yes, Mr Donald Trump may be well advised to donate the money to alleviate the problems created by the Hurricane Sandy. Of course, since he has a large presence in Atlantic City, part of this donation may even be used to help his own establishments come out of the misery. \r\n \r\nIn any case, if he really wants to help the nation (rather than Barak Obama), this is the best opportunity. As far as Obama's Election needs are concerned, if he comes out positive in his efforts to restore normalcy, both in terms of speed and quality, he may emerge victorious at the Election, anyhow. And thus, Mr Trumpp would also get the name for putting nation before an individual.

I love how people focus on ONE LINE he said. He makes a valid point. Government aide comes out of the tax payers pocket. He says "I want them to have the resources that are necessary" right there in black and white print. Financial aide is not for shopping sprees on luxury items people! He is pointing out the FACT that SOME people wasted their TAX PAYER GIVEN  money on gucci bags and massages after katrina. He is just saying he hopes that the victims of Sandy will make a financial plan. How is that heartless? He is trying to sheppard the money YOU PAID INTO THE SYSTEM. I am NOT SORRY when I say I agree. I don't want to be seeing my hard earned money, which the government takes out of my families paychecks, be wasted on someone giving themselves frivolous items. It should be spent on repairing the damage and replacing what was lost. It is not a free ride.

Even when the bible speaks against acts such as homosexuality it's about christians not doing it. It doesn't require you to shun or kill those that do. Forgiveness and tolerance is a defining theme of the bible. A baby assumes life when born not a fertile egg or a fetus. The bible is against many Mormon values such as taking multiple wives and bizarre beliefs that a true christian would consider adolotry.

All of those things, old testament.  Eat any shellfish this year?  The god of the desert sentences you to the same fate as homos.  Work on sunday? same fate.  Your Jesus, however (according to the cannon that was created decades after his death and manipulated and rewritten by the church), said nothing about abortion or same sex relationships despite the church's will to control the populace with a narrative that was favorable to their guilt driven solicitation (indulgences).  Jesus befriended (and possibly married) a prostitute whom, by your logic, was actually in breach of at least two of the commandments.  On the other hand, Jesus told his followers to give away all their belongings to help their fellow man...which is roughly the diametric opposite of what Romney is asking.  That's before you consider the budget and ethical implications of Sheldon Adelson's military strike on Iran (a policy for which he has already paid Romney).   Also consider the old testament looks at abortion with a mild dislike rather than a vehement opposition, check it out: Ecclesiastes 6:3-5 Ecclesiastes 4:1-3 \r\nExodus -25 \r\nSo if you are voting on values, you might want to rethink your support for Romney.

Mike Huckabee knows that true believers in Jesus believe that one day they will all stand before Jesus and will answer two questions: 1) What did you do with Jesus? and 2) What did you do with the talents and opportunities that God gave you?  Even though believers are saved and will remain in Heaven, they will still answer these questions.  Col. Oliver North, now a Christian, said "I had rather live my life as though there were a God and find out that there was not than to live my life as though there were no God and find out that there was a God." Huckabee is simply saying to the 18 million believers that did not vote in the last election that this time the importance of this election is monumental and it is up to each one of those 18 million voters to get out and not only vote but vote according to what our Bible, God's Word says.  America was founded on people's rights one of which is the freedom OF religion which is just as important as anyone's right to not have a religion.  Freedom of choice is what this country is about.  Taken away, everyone will be told where to work, where they can go, how long they will work, how much money they will be GIVEN for their work.  Nothing in this world is free and if it is it will not last.\r\nHuckabee is simply reminding people who say they believe in one thing but vote in another manner that they will be held accountable in Heaven for their actions or inactions.

Whaaat?!!!! This moron  Michael Brown , barely acted at all immediately after Katrina..  Hundreds of people died  waiting for his stupid azz to act and step in with disaster assistance.. When he finally did the trailers that FEMA put people who lost their homes in were contaminated, substandard boxes that made people sick ..... He should have been washed away in Sandy like so much debris !!!!!  who the f_uck is he to say anything.... President Obama did what is expected from the POTUS .... He put the people under his watch first ... they needed help and he acted !!!!

Mr Huckabee you are so right about voting for the wrong person, but what about your partys backing of the likes of Limbaugh, Coulter,O"Reilly,Can  ​ tor,Gingrich,Rove,Ch  ​ eney,McCain,Mourdock  ​ ,Palin,Bachman just to name a few. I think you need to worry about your judgement day alot more if you back these Ungodly individuals. I'm surprised you would inject God into these Politics since the GOP are truly the conduit for" The Great Deceiver". You also work for Faux(fox)News who knowingly lie to support the Republican Agenda. HYPOCRITE EXTRAORDINARE.Maybe you need to revisit your bible and read Matt.22:37-40,Matt:2  ​ 3:23-28,Lev.19:16, just a few of Gods words you seem to have forgotten. I thought you were better than this as ahuman being,very disappointing.

Catholics are Christians, I can accept that. They have too much emphasis on idealogy and praying to others who are not God. (The whole Confessional thing is also too much. Just adds an extra arbiter between you and God. If you want to Confide in someone that's one thing. But if you want to be Forgiven you have to ask for it. Or did what happened the the Sorcerer Simon? He asked the Apostles to ask God for Forgiveness rather than do it himself. But I digress.) I can accept Catholics as being, at heart, Christian.\r\n \r\nMormons are not Christian. Not even close. They are a combination of Christianity and Nationalism. Literally: They seek to affirm the USA as God's other favourite Child (the first being Israel) and that the USA is somehow tied together with the fate of Israel. That's not a slight confusion. Or a minor detail. That's straight up blasphemy and is NOT compatible with Scripture in any way shape or form. Then there's the other details: Satan and Jesus are/were brothers. Constantly changing designs/plans of God (Really? How often has God said he changed his mind? I thought his name is the: I Am.) conviently everytime the US government says they need to stop doing something. The favourtism. And that's just off the top of my head. Mormon's are not a Christian religion. They're about as Christian as Islam. Actually less so: Islam doesn't try and elevate particular countries (even though they do have a Holy Land) Steer clear of them.

Has there ever been a more dysfunctional show? A main character, Dr. Burke, was fired after repeated gay slurs. The gay actor was then let go despite his popularity. Katherine Hiegl's head got so big, they released her while still under contract. Patrick Dempsey stated that his hobby, car racing was more important. \r\n When it gets to the point where every character is in their 3rd or 4th life threatening medical crisis, it's time to go.It's like lawyer shows where every character goes on trial for murder. It was great in the beginning, but has worn out it's welcome.

How do you know how many jobs would have been created without the tax cuts?  There is no control economy that you can compare it to.  It is possible that without the tax cuts, unemployment would have been 2 percentage points higher under Bush.  There is really no way to tell.  Economists all have theories, but no scientific data, because of the aforementioned lack of a control sample (economy) \r\n  \r\nIt is kind of like when Obama said he will create 2 million jobs, and when that didn't pan out, he turns the statement into "created or SAVED 2 million jobs".  How do you know how many jobs were saved?  You just can know that 2 million were not created by comparing the employement numbers before and after the massive "stimulus"

get it right there is no separation of Church and state( Danbury letter was asking if there would be a state run religion the answer was no.) Government is not to get into a mans religious believe. man has the right to have those believes protected under the constitution.  the governments job is to protect those rights not to tell him that he has to pay for that which he dose not believe in. or stand back and be quiet He has a right to speak his piece.

Its funny how people are criticizing  Romney for doing a good thing he cant get donations and food for people impacted by the storm in those areas he has to get them else where. He turned a political event into a charity event to help those in need yet you guys give him crap about it . Also there is a good point to compare how he is acting this time over how he acted when Americans where killed this 9-11. He finally did his job for once where last time he was more concerned with not telling us whats going on and going to Vegas to get donations for his campaign. An we dont have to respect him or anything unless he has earned it, and over the past 4 years he has not earned the respect from me and all the other people not blinded by his lies. An if you question that then you, your self are blind and a fool, cuaz i didn't fight over in Iraq to watch this Amazing country go down the drain any further then it already has under Obama. \r\n\r\nSo Vote Romney, Vote for your self. But dont Vote Blindly for lies and unkept promises!

Money,\r\n  \r\n Another good Movie  to see is:  Slavery by Another Name.......... Shows how the oil, coal, the railroad, and steel industry, and Farmers,  used Blacks in Southern jails and Prison's as FREE labor....from 1865.up until the mid1940's......They rented Blacks for less than 10 dollars a month and worked them to death and would then send for more......Most of the Black's were convicted of bogus crimes to get them into the system to make Slaves out of them....It's was on PBS.......where non-partisanTruth is found...... Can be watched here:   http://www.slaveryby  ​ anothername.com/ Most American's don't know this ever happened......and especially will be shocked to know this practice continued until 1945.... When slavery was Legal Black Slaves were treated much better as they were REAL PROPERTY and had VALUE....just like a Tractor......These men had no Value and could be easily replaced and were treated in a manner that most American's would not believe could happen in the 19th and  20th Century......It's a must see...I had both my kids watch the movie....All Americans need to see this movie in my opinion..

I wouldn't listen to anyone that was hired or appointed by the BUSH administration.\r\n \r\nBUSH (and the GOP in general) pride themselves on ignorance, and have contempt for the highly educated. \r\n \r\nThis guy is no different. This guy didn't act with Katrina, because he probably believes it's not the role of government to help anyone in need. \r\n \r\nAnother example of how the BUSH administration didn't believe in hiring competent people, is at the Justice Dept. During BUSH presidency, BUSH had the Justice Dept. hire lawyers to head the Civil Rights Division, that  had no experience in Civil Rights Law. Obviously, A justice Dept. that has inexperienced lawyers wouldn't be effective in enforcing federal Civil Rights laws; but  this was the pricise intention of the BUSH administration. With agencies that the GOP doesn't like, what the GOP does is appoint weak , incompetent people to head those agencies, such that, the enforcement capabalilities of that agency is compromised. They do this, together with cutting of funding to whatever enforcers they don't like. \r\n \r\nGovornor Chris Christie said our President has done and is doing a excellant job with this hurricane.\r\nWhile Romney is out having a campaign rally that he tried to say was a "hurriance benefit" event.\r\n \r\nPresident Obama will take care of those in need on the east coast, and on November 6, we will be looking at 4 more years for Barrack Obama!

To honestly think a person’s religion will have no effect on how they govern is pretty ignorant.  Also it’s not out of the box for people to protect their moral views by electing based on a handful of ideals vrs the overall picture.  One must determine what they are willing to trade and we often times find that people will suffer through harder times to protect their values rather than give them up for general prosperity. We all do this barter system when it comes to electing and that’s perfectly ok.  It means we are engaged and feel our vote has tangible value within the system.  So the man had an opinion, big whoopty-do.  We all have opinions and base our daily decisions on them, only difference is ours aren’t plastered on the internet to be judged.

ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. — President Barack Obama jetted to storm-stricken New Jersey on Wednesday for a first-hand look at the devastation, as his aides tried to keep overt politics at bay for one more day. \r\nObama is telling New Jersey residents devastated by a massive storm that "we're going to be here for the long haul." \r\nJoined by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Obama inspected the devastation from superstorm Sandy, flying high over flooded neighborhoods and sand-strewn streets. \r\nAt a community center where people have taken shelter, Obama said one of his top priorities is getting power back on. \r\nChristie said it was "really important" to have the president of the United States in New Jersey."" \r\n  \r\nCLASSIC READ THE LAST SENTENCE. : )

Anything to keep his name in the news.  Well, not anything--he COULD just donate that money, no strings attached, to help all his neighbors up and down the east coast who have lost everything to Sandy...........now there's a concept!

What can the black leaders in Minneapolis do about it? There's nothing they can do.  If the Minnesota Timberwolves win an NBA championship, that could shock the world. I doubt that would happen though.

Yeah it takes more faith to believe that there was this massive big explosion and this earth full of every beautiful and good thing resulted out of it.   Use your imagination for something good.  Look at the mountains the oceans, the skiy,every kind of  flower and tree full of fruits with every different flavor , diamonds and jewels  and  and His greatest creation man and even plants and herbs   to be used to heal our bodies who were created to to heal themselves.   You are really missing the big picture  because you believed someones lies and it has blinded you. Ask God to open your eyes and ears and help you  to become  aware of your surroundings.  I have know trouble believing in God or heaven, all I have to do  look around and I know someone much greater than me provided all this.

yes, i think he's just being responsible for everyone's safety, you can always have halloween partys in safe homes , or a safe church annex, community center , etc. and he's not fully takin away halloween he just postphoned it. i agree with his remark about the halloween spirit and then the kids can have more time to work on pumpkins, costumes, etc. Good for him !

Hi MN;  The original framers also conisidered we as those in an autonomous Republic.  The New World Order does away with our autonomy.  We are no longer functioning under the US Constitution.  Just wait a couple months till after the election and then lets talk who framed who and what. We are going to be super harmed.  Only wish "WE" could have voted on whether we wanted to give up our autonomy.

WOW! People have way too much time on there hands. Get a life and do something possitive instead of lieing about a natural disaster that people are losing there lives in. And if you look close enough the pictures are obvious fakes.

Absolutely. The word is DEVASTATING!!!!!!!!!  ​ !!!! The damage unbelievable. We don't need children out in the middle of this. And anyway, NOBODY'S HOME!!!!!!!!

How long does it take to tell the story of how he met his kids' mother? Over 7 seasons, apparently!

It is quite interesting that the GOP lawmakers hardly criticized President Bush's administration and FEMA after Katrina, choosing instead to chastise some New Orleans residents for not heeding the government's warnings to vacate the area around the 9th Ward while simultaneously skewering Louisiana State and local officials for not being better prepared.  Now, with one of their own political darlings running the State of New Jersey, they are caught in a bind about their election year's slogans about FEMA so they now criticize President Obama for jumping in with FEMA too early despite the loss of lives and property.  Seems like "Compassionate Conservative" was just a convenient slogan for only 1 administration under W and not actually embraced by the GOP.  Or should it be termed "Convenient Compassionate Conservatism"?  At least Governor Chris Christy understands where the butter for his state's bread is coming from after this disaster and has exercised the integrity to give credit to FEMA and the President.  Where is Romney's (and Ryan's, Rove's and Boehner's) integrity?

I guess one way to look at this is, at least they aren't remaking the original 3.

Don't get many "big storms" around here, but I remember a number of years ago when we had microbursts blowing through. I think we were doing some school shopping and wound up having to stay in the store for a while because the wind was blowing shopping carts around and pushing large trees over.
1
The President seems to react to situations based on his need to use Air force One, he asked the mayor of NYC to come see the damage himself, answer no thanks, besides everyone at the set of the View were out and even if he was going to the UN, nobody home. The Pres could have sent a drone, unarmed of course, but he hasn't been given any instructions on its use, that's no fun. Libya, guess what? No body there either. As grounded as the Pres is, for one of the first time he must look like he's doing his job, damit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sorry for the campaign quote.

Huckabee had my support until the last 3 years revealed he'd rather serve the Republicans than serve God. He's been dabbling with fire and this ad is not a good thing. Citing "the will of God is this" or "the will of God is that" is something the Roman Catholic Church did. We don't need to repeat history. I encourage you to send a letter to your preferred party of choice and tell them to pound sand; such parties don't deserve to win if they think we're so hopelessly enslaved to them that we don't have a right to reject their choice of Candidate for Us.

M.O. to a tee. Don't you love how he always says stay off my threads, yet he always comes to us??? I may read RTP/MP's comments but I don't post on them. It's hard not to read his comment since at least one of his characters seems to post somewhere all the time on this site. I love how he talks about preparing several course meals for his "wife" yet how does he cook and continually post comments not to mention he never spends time with her once she's home. Who knows maybe she finds him just as annoying.\r\n\r\nWell hopefully by posting his address he had some visitors to keep him company.

you are all indoctrinated fools if you belive that these elections make a difference. Obama and romney are the same people, they say exactly what the other one says. Just like the presidential debate not to long ago they only say 1 or 2 things that are different but their goal is relatively the same. What makes you think after having a federal reserve, a corrupt government, and the people who inhabit this country are pathetic fools who can't see the difference, why do you need a driver license? why do you need to pay the IRS which isn't a government Institution. yeah thats right people just throw your money away make all the private sector rich as all can be and eventually buy us out of our constitution. zeitgeist addendum is a great documentary to educate yourserlf, and a book i read called "Confessions of an economic hitman"... Good day Gentlemen. "Politics can not solve problems because they are not trained to do so."

Romney wants to go to New Jersey to yell at Christie for thanking Obama for the fast emergency response. \r\n \r\n"Natural disasters happen," said Romney. "People have brooms, let them sweep it all under the rugs, like I do with my dirty business."

What good things? Saddling us with the ACA, doing nothing about the deficit and debt when he had a lock on Congress, saving the UAW with government money, openly declaring war on the oil and coal industries, wasting 800 billion in stimulus for no apparent gain, turning illegals into citizens without due process, ignoring the thousands of "shovel ready projects" in numerous states so he could use the money for his buddies, the list just keeps getting longer.  Obama has already half-slaughtered America, he now wants another four years to finish the job.
1
Huckabee is a classic windbag/Elmer Gantry PHONY who would say nearly anything for $$$. Why do you think he is called "The Huckster" and "Huck-a-buck" in his home state of Arkansas?  \r\n He is a money-grubber from the word go and is setting up for another Presidential run in the event the Mormon loses...

Obama bailed out the auto industry, GAVE Chrysler to Fiat for free.  Now there's a recording of the CEO of Fiat saying" we will outsource Jeep".  If you haven't heard it stop listening to the LIAR MEDIA...LIBTARD
1
What's even more interesting is that Romney wants to cut FEMA and send money to the states to handle things. When you think about that....what about the states who would use that money to balance a budget or use it someplace else and there are no funds available to help in situations like this.

Sorry MSN, but I'm not going to let you be two-faced her. I'm calling a "Spade a Spade". Perhaps Mr. brown was too abrupt in his criticism of Obama getting out in front of the hurricane issue, but the fact of the matter is that he should have been out in front of the Benghazi attack too. They are  not all that dissimilar. A crisis is a crisis and if you're good at being ahead of the curve on one, you should be able to be ahead of the curve on the other. Benghazi occurred on the anniversay of 9/11 and seeing as how the Middle East has been a deathbed for many Americans since the hostages were taken in Iran 33 years ago, there is NO EXCUSE for having lost 4 American lives to terrorists 6 weeks ago. Obama screwed up big time in Libya and needs to be accountable  and take responsibility for his blunder!!!

Mike Huckabee needs to be put away in a mental intuition.  To tell people that they will go to hell if they vote for Obama is a disgrace to all religions.  No wonder he stuck up for that wacko in Mo.  he is just as bad.  To vote for Romney is a vote for a cult member and not a true christian.  Is Huckabee trying to get money or a place with Romney.  Huckabee is a man without true faith in God to use religion this way he should be ashamed.  I'm a Catholic and a Vote for the only true Christian is Obama!!!!!!!!!!!!

How would you cast it these days... Princess Leia: Kim K, no. (Wookie sex tape?!) Scarlett J, no. (Annoying)  Octomom, no. (too cracked out) Snooki, no. (Put foot through TV). Olga Kurylenko, no (would spend the entire movie naked). Taylor Swift, no (she would have to write songs about all the wookies she had slept with). Charlize, no (she would bite the heads off all the wookies and then eat them).  Jennifer A, no (no one would hang around for more than a few weeks). Luke: Biebs, no. (Scared of own shadow) La Boof, no, (Idiot) R. Pattz, no, (scared of wookies). Han Solo: Tom Cruise, no (too weird). Daniel Craig, no (too violent - would shag all the wookies and then kill everyone else after blowing up their space ships). Mark Walhberg, no (kissed a monkey in Apes, so would be chasing wookie around). So, Sophie Vergara as Leia in wet white robes and constant wardrobe malfunctions, Justin Timberlake as Luke because there isn't anyone else, and Ryan Seacreast as the all singing, all dancing Han Solo who forms a close relationship with an Ewok who isn't gay.

I am a Christian, and I disagree with this idiot 100%.  If this is the attitude of the Church, then its time to start taxing the Churches.\r\n \r\nI know for a fact God would not support a cold hearted person like Romney is.  A typical stuck up rich snob in life, who has no care whatsoever about the poor in life.  I guarantee you God does not have that same attitude.

When obama tries to destroy the very root of this country and throw his radical agenda in the faces of Christians, obamacre, then religion does become part of the political agenda.  How else can we fight for our rights and put this liar, radical muslim in his place.  Or does he have a place in OUR AMERICA?

Little late to think of a flood gate.  Should have done that years ago,

Well, if you want to put labels on it, a "true Christian" tolerates everyone, whether they are gay, straight, bisexual, etc., because it is not our place to judge others. Same goes for right to CHOOSE. That's right. I said it. A woman has a right to choose what happens in her body. If she wants to have an abortion, that is her right. A fetus is not a baby until it is born! As a woman myself, I think there is something extremely wrong with the fact that women's issues are being discussed and settled upon by men. So if you want to know what a "true Christian" - or better yet, just a good person - believes, it is to live and let live. An it harm none, do what thou wilt. Blessed be!

As a conservative christian I do not agree. Now I will make everyone crazy. Christians are to be in the world and not of the world. Politics is compromise and the Lord hates compromise. The truth is not up for negotiation and there has never been a politician that has not sacrificed the truth.Make no mistake, the day will come and the world will be ruled as a theocracy with one King, the Lord Jesus. However, during this present age, the church is not leading people to truth via the ballot box. We are making enemies instead of loving our enemies. I am no liberal, and I am not advocating for doing those things that the Lord abhors, Jesus said "If the salt loses it's saltiness, how can it be made salty again?" We are losing our saltiness and the Lord will soon return. As christians we need to remember that Christ died for us while we were yet sinners and approach those who also need the burden of sin lifted from their shoulders upon that basis.

I think he should donate a lot more money for the hurricane relief without all the drama!  It really doesn't make any difference if OB produces the documents they would be fixed any way.  Getting right down to it personally I don't like either candidate however OB has more class in his little finger not to succumb to this cheap act than DT has in his whole body.  I would rather vote for Maxine!!!!!!

It's the point that he shouldn't have the audacity to make such an offer in the first place, not to a sitting President.. it's beneath the President to lower himself to that kind of thing.. I wouldn't do it either.. Trump is only looking to set himself up as a 'hero'.. nothing more. \r\nIn the end, if Trump, with all his money and his grandiose bragging couldn't find anything, then there's nothing to find. Period.

I agree that the show was better with Charlie Sheen but I see Ashton Kutcher as a welcome change from all the obnoxious behavior it seems true to his personal life as well.  I think they need to butch it up a bit for Walden.  His boyish character is annoying.  You can't make him into a Charlie Harper but he is too much of a milky character.  He needs some darkness.   Alan is fun and I think saves what is left of this show.  With that said I agree with someone who said he whiny, blood sucking antics is boring.  He needs a pair, if you know what I mean.  And how long can Jake be so stupid?  I am glad Rose is back and they need to use Mrs Harper a lot more.

No. I love it when people appoint power they really don't have. People are dead and lives have been changed forever, and Mr Christie is worry about candy, and Halloween parties, really. If there is a big storm on Dec 24, is he planning on postponing the birth of Christ. How about New Years, or Thanksgiving, while this is the 1st storm of the winter, it's not gonna be the last.  In the wake of everything that has happened this week, Halloween is not a part of the big picture, and Mr Christie should get back on point.

No! Let the people know what's coming and the potential dangers... decrease or eliminate deaths.
1
I have seen towns do it because off all the DUI drivers out that night for Halloween parties (specifically St Albans WV)  ....so to do it because of obvious unsafe conditions is the right decision.  Besides the stores aren't open for people to get candy to give out.  The kids will come out ahead because of the delay with their candy haul and under safer conditions.
1
No tog- FEMA has demonstrated that it is a ineffective, slow to act, worst governmental agency we have. We need to take a good hard look at FEMA & evaluate its continued existence as it is now. If your watching your TV, you'll see the National Guard & Red Cross with 'boots on the ground' providing aid and comfort for the victims of Sandy. While I don't have all the answers as to how FEMA should be reformed, the National Guard & Red Cross are highly more effective in disaster relief than FEMA ever was. These are the organizations that are the first responders & maybe FEMA should be 'sliced' up & given to them. Run it nationally, implement it locally.

I guess the Commandment concerning bearing false witness is very negotiable to this republican demogogue and his political, self serving public 'Christianity." their hypocrisy is only transcended by their desire to win at any election at any cost, up to and including the topplig this once fine nation. Shouldn't he stop judging how others vote,and be concerned about the eternal consequences of HIS own vote? oh, that's right he thinks he is the abiter of what is right and wrong. Somehwere in that book he so desperately clngs to when it serves him; their is a quotation that reads........:judge not, lest ye Be judged," now you know why Jesus Wept. its because of false witnesses like him.

Well, of course the states should foot the bill for Irene.  Everybody knows that the largely democratic voters of these states caused the storms.  I, personally, went outside with a bucket and tried to pour extra water along the shoreline, and tried to whip up the winds so that we could get FEMA funding.  \r\n \r\nThis man has no shame.  While we here in the northeast are trying to recover from the devastation, he is lying about the auto industry bailout because he knows the attention among those who oppose him are elsewhere.  I used to think he was a decent guy who just wanted too badly yo get elected to take a stand that he really believed.  He has clearly crossed that line and has become a bld-faced liar wh cares not one whit about the ordinary citizens of this country.\r\n \r\nMitt, Have you no shame?

The worse thing that Obama could do is to even give Trump the time of day.  The president has more important things to do then to be distracted by this windbag.  Obama has to deal with the aftermath of a real windstorm.  It is called running the country Mr Trump and taking care of the needs of the people of the East Coast that are hurting and in trouble.  What an absolute jerk!

WS -- It might be a matter of timing. After all, 50 Americans died over the last couple of days, millions are still without power, hundreds of thousands are homeless. It just doesn't seem like this should be the first thing that a person in his position would be concerned about. It doesn't show much compassion or leadership ability, in my opinion.

Not a real big fan of the show, but the wife is.  She was surprised at the elimination of Sabrina rather than Kirstie, and from what I saw I agree.  I guess Kirstie has a bigger fan base than Sabrina.   \r\n  \r\nWhat I do find funny if the folks who were so against Bristol and were complaining about her "fan base" keeping her in the competition are not nearly as upset as they are about Kirstie's fans keeping her in.  I though Bristol was far batter than Kirstie, but she was still voted off before her.  Was this because so many hated her mother so much?

The question is not whether we support or oppose abortion.  The question is whether or not we want a law governing a woman's health care decisions.\r\n \r\nSome try to claim they support an exception for the "health of the mother".  Guess what - pregnancy creates a health risk for the mother, so that covers everyone.  The question then becomes, what type of risk, how much risk, how is it defined, who makes the decision, how is the law worded, how is it enforced...  Legislation of this health decision is a very poor approach to the stated goal of reducing or ending abortion.\r\n \r\nAlso, if the reason for the law is to protect the unborn child, then why do the same people refuse to provide for adequate nutrition, health care, and shelter for the mother?  That is very important to the health of the child.  It also makes no sense that these same people stop caring about the child at the delivery room door.  Suddenly, a one minute old infant is on his own, or is someone else's concern.  It makes no sense at all!

Real glad Lucasfilm was sold to Disney and nothing else. \r\nI guess when "fans" like to constantly critisize George Lucas's work (after SW episode 6) this is what it leads to.. retiring and selling.\r\nPeople keep talking about "money" "money" "money" but honestly, if everything youre making is making people talk crap all the time what else are you going to do?? "obiviously" people doesnt like it.\r\nyeah, he SOLD his work, hes allowed because he created it and deserves what he gets! and if thats money then its money, he worked hard for it. so i give props!!\r\nDisney will do a great job!! theres no doubt.\r\nand the most important part is the fact that STAR WARS WILL LIVE ON.\r\nonly true fans will see that, instead of talking more crap.

Mr. Maclean's fine certainly was too much! but leave it to a bunch of politicos to screw up what is an already screwed up law, because if they really wanted to put a dent in their nation's deficit and/or its national debt, they would charge normal,  "wolf-whistling" guys, according to the Quality, and the relative Quantity of the booty that they're - well Hello! - peering at, and their cops would thereafter inform them that they were perhaps, enjoying the likes of one an Ines Sainz who is "on holiday", and that their fine will be $186, not $93, thank you very much. : )

I agree with the above except for Attack of the Clones being worse than Phantom. Phantom really had only 2 scenes that were worthwhile; the Pod race and of course the fight with Darth Maul. Clones on the other hand had the making of the Stormtroopers, brief exciting fight with Jango Fett, Yoda fight and the finale in the Colosseum. Phantom was the worst of the whole series but then each subsequent film became better. Empire was the best.

No, I think that he should take his money and help the parents of those men that were killed at our embassy in Libya and sue Obama and his committee.  He has great lawyers and he could inspire the American people in a way that no other person could do to prove the incapability of this president and his staff.

Romney's an idiot as usual.  Trying to back peddle as usual too.   He is a selfish, greedy, stupid puppet for all his millionaire and billionaire friends.   He doesn't care about anyone or anything else.   He grew up wealthy and has no clue about what the average working class Americans life is like.   The fact that he has been able to lie and convince some that he is a caring, kind person wanting to build America again is unbelievable to me.   Unless your pockets are lined with gold he could care less about you.  Please read him for who he really is.   I hope and pray that people vote for Obama.   Just think about all the people affected by this hurricane and the help they wouldn't get from this ****!

Religion has convinced people that there’s an invisible man…living in the sky, who watches everything you do every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a list of ten specific things he doesn’t want you to do. And if you do any of these things, he will send you to a special place, of burning and fire and smoke and torture and anguish for you to live forever, and suffer and burn and scream until the end of time. But he loves you. He loves you and he needs money.

I always thought that there were supposed to be nine films in total.  The first three released would be the middle three in the story, the next three the backstory, then the final three to wrap up the entire epic.  I was kinda disappointed when Lucas said that there would be no more after the "Revenge of the Sith."

Pro Spiderman, \r\nYou do not speak for us that are negative about it. Firstly, you are absolutely wrong; Secondly you have no clue. \r\nWE understand it takes constant dedication from morning to night, eating the right amount mix of prtotien and amino acids. WE also know its an obsession that has very little payout for most people that get involved with it, most do steroids and it DOES CHANGE their personal behavior.\r\nI have (had) very good friends that led good family lives, great jobs; all until they took up serious body building, it overtakes them. Suddenly trying to get 1/2 pound more muscle on their calves is more important than their own families, or more important than making to work on time because they had to get that extra 20 minute crunch time on the weights... and all for what purpose? To obtain a look that looks like someone shoved a water hose up you butt and left it running.. and knowing you cant even keep it forever...

A drunk bar owner told me to "Get out of my bar, we only serve people who want to have "real" drinks here..." because I happened not to be drinking that day. Instead I was drinking her $2.00 12 oz. cans of Coca Cola. I was litterly shocked and embarassed when this drunk b!tch said this half the bar. I immediatly left and have never returned.\r\nWhat really pisses me off though is that my friends and brothers still are regular patrons at this bar. I don't know, maybe they aere not as good of friends as I had thought because I know if some dried up, pickled, alcoholic, bar owner said that to one of my friends I would have supported them 100% by NEVER going back to that bar and being a paying customer again. Again, that's just what I would do but who am I to tell my "friends" where to spend their money.\r\nNOTE: And it's not like this bar was in a small town where it was the only bar around for miles and miles. The town has around 20,000 people and there are 11 other bars along the same road within 2 to 3 miles of each other. Yes, your right. Maybe it is tgime to find some new friends...

I did.  I was enamored of the idea for hope and change.  Instead, we are divisive, combative, and completely unproductive.  You can't blame that bad leadership on Bush - the buck stops at the current person at the top.  It always amazes me how we are willing to let leaders not take responsibility for the bad things that happen on their watch. \r\n New leadership is needed.

It is not mother nature it is father God that has spoken...every state Constitution written by their founders give a direct reference to Almighty God. America is now engaging in a war against God and if you would take a chance to read just a few prophecies regarding the nation of Israel in the last days you would clearly see that all the nations that treat Israel harshly God will judge/destroy. No matter right or left Republican or Democrat almost all of our presidents are guilty of treating God's chosen people unfairly. There is a clear connection just as John's book "As America has done to Israel" points out. God is very serious about His Word and He will watch over His Word. Things are not going to turn around unless there is a national repentance turning away from sin. We are all responsible for we all have fallen short no one is without sin but "while we were yet sinners Christ died for us". At the DNC they booed Israel and the mention of God and acknowledged gay marriage for the first time in history. Since God created everything does He not have a right to judge His Creation? Choose you this day whom you will serve for it has eternal consequences.

Oh really?  And if we "drill baby drill" we'll export even more, drawing down our reserves even further.  \r\n  \r\nBottom line is that ramping up our oil production will have negligible effect on the price of oil world-wide and with how involved we are in the global economy it will barely effect the price we pay at the pump...  \r\n  \r\nAll it would do it use up our domestic oil, which we should be saving.  \r\n  \r\nAmericans are so effing short sighted.

Support FEMA for what? FEMA is just an excuse to shut the victims up by making them think help is on the way. Remember Katrina, well they are still waiting for help. The only ones that are going to get Government help is the State, county and city governments, and maybe just maybe the victims with get a promise and a crumb.  I can see Obama and Romney now saying lets take the money from the Medicare and social security to help pay for this mess, as the old codgers don't need it. You can best bet the politicians are going to make billions off of this tragedy also.

One time I watched several of these in a row, continually horrified at how badly people let themselves go.  I felt like my brain was simply numb after it all and immediately skip it every time I see it on now.  Yes there's a certain degree of morbid fascination with watching how utterly disgusting people are but the truth is the show can't possibly solve in one show the deeply embedded psychological issues the hoarders have.  When some old lady fights her kids over every single item them want to remove from the house - and there are of course many many thousands of items that simply need to be thrown away - you see the derangement right in front of you.  It's hideous.

Those officers used restraint.  These days,  they would mostly  taze people instead.\r\nYou want to be heard in a public meeting?  Write it down so it all goes in the record.  Then summarize from your written comments during your lousy 3 minutes in the limelight.\r\nThree minutes might not be enough for most people to get their point across,  but there IS a mechanism for them to do it without getting cuffed or removed by force.

Those leaving negative comments do so because they don't know the amount of effort and time, nor the sacrifice that is put into looking like they (the body builders) do. Ignorant people think that to acheive these results it's all a matter of taking steroids and BAM! you get huge, but when in reality it doesn't. Because if they knew the truth, that if you take steroids and not eat right nor dedicate the time to work out a fat-tubb of lard will be the results. Yes it is true that most of those pictured most likely do take steroids, but that is because they are not satisfied with their "natural" end results and always strive to get just a bit bigger.\r\n       All in all I guess I just wanted to say some people are leaving negative comments because they are ignorant of the body builder scene and don't realize the sacrifices that are taken to achieve the look for a day or two's worth of competition, and that like mentioned in another comment they don't always look like in the pictures above.

Yes folks, the republicans want to eliminate every government program that helps people, including fema. They want to ship all responsibilities off to states or to private business, we still have to pay for them, just have to pay local and state governments instead of the feds. Will they balance the budget, hell no, they will spend the same as the dems, just that they will spend it on a bloated military and guess what?  Sounds like a military state to me...is blackwater akin to the SS troops or the Nazis, think about it!!! We spend more on military than the next 10 biggest spendering countries in the world, how about those big donations from weapons providers republicans? How can any real christian vote for the war hawk republicans? Wouldn't Jesus help the people? oh ya, we are less "free" than we were before the Bush fiasco and 911. I wish some of the "skeeters" would read this but  they don't read much.

I agree with FredTheDog.  The body builders of yesteryear were much attractive to look at and were more symetrical.   It seems that these guys pack on slabs of pounds of muscle with the aids of massives amounts of Testoterone and Steroids and cutting agents.  Serge Nubret, Arnold S. and Frank Zane were definitely more cut and better built than these cats.   Although I will admit that they did put in the work, I still say the body builders of the 70's and 80's put alot of planning and discipline in there workout regimens. \r\nI will be interesting to see how these guys health pan out in 10 years from now.

The problem with the proposal of shifting Federal programs (Medicaid,  FEMA) and others as Romney proposes to the States is, many are broke and with a natural disaster many could not afford to rebuild and repair. Years after disasters you can see areas in poor States where they are slums, multiply this X 100 and you have the Romney plan of everyman for themself, and the poor States fall further behind. Romney is out of touch and fails most of America, all except the wealthy....

ROMNEY, YOU ARE NOT A LEADER, BUT A FOLLOWER OF THE MONEY,   MANY TIMES YOU HAVE GIVEN YOUR OPINION ABOUT "FEMA". YOU WANTS TO CUT THE MONEY FOR FEMA AS RYAN AND CANTOR DID A WHILE BACK! YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN A FORM OF PRIVATIZED FEMA WHEN YOU BECOME PRESIDENT, AND GIVE THE BUSINESS OF PROTECTING OF OUR CITIZENS IN THE EVENT OF STORMS, EARTHQUAKES, HURRICANES TO A JUNKY PRIVATE AGENCY TO MAINTAIN THE ORDER AND RESCUE OPERATIONS OF OUR CITIZENS. WITH THIS MASSIVE STORM THAT HIT US SO HARD, A PRIVATE BUSINESS TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE HAD BEEN A FOOLISH JOKE. NO PRIVATE FIRM CAN MOBILIZE THOUSAND OF GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL AND FIRST RESPONDERS ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY WITH PRECISION, ENERGY, TRUST AND PERSEVERANCE, AND FAST RESCUE PROCEDURES THAN A WELL ORGANIZED GOVERNMENT AGENCY TO HELP OUR PEOPLE CAN DO ---SO ROMNEY, YOU ARE SICK IN THE HEAD, LEARN A NEW LESSON, WE DO NOT WANT YOU BECAUSE YOU WILL GIVE THE SALVATION OF OUR PEOPLE TO A JUNKY AGENCY THAT WILL BE SLEEPING DURING THE WHOLE DISASTER! YOUR AGENCY WILL BE A DUPLICATE OF BUSH FEMA, AND THAT WE WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS TIME. SO GO ON TO YOUR CAR ELEVATORS AND MONEY A LEAVE US ALONG. VOTE FOR OBAMA THE TRUE CARE PRESIDENT ON NOV 6, 2012

Music director, just a note on the catholics and paying for insurance that is required to provide contraceptive. Unless these catholic institutions only pay their employees in 'catholic cash', any employee can go an pay for contraceptives with their paycheck (money from the catholic institution). Just because the option is part of the insurance does not mean the catholics are sinning because they are helping others to sin (their employees have had the choice to get contraceptives for quite a while now). As christians they should be couseling women about their options and comforting them in their time of stress and concern. \r\nOn a seperate note to those that claim Obama is not christion because he is pro choice; Obama is for women to make their own decisions about contraception and abortion, that in no way states wether he is for or against it personally (which should not matter).

It was too bad that Harold Camping did not succeed in taking away the base of the repuke dunce party. \r\nHarold Camping, the evangelical king, got 500,000 of these pathetic radical right wing braindead evangelical Children of the Corn zombies to give up all of their worldly possessions to go meet and stay with the man in the sky. They are so easily brainwashed. Camping, considered the evangelical king by many because of his 50 year history of bible study, promised to take away these right wing bible nuts on the last Rapture Day on Oct 21, 2011. All of his calculations were based on "biblical facts" When it did not work, he then realized that the bible in most part is "pulp fiction". \r\nYet these braindead fools continue to believe that there are men and boys with wings on flying around blowing horns. \r\nThe only thing to do to cure these zombies is to send them all back to the Garden of Eden on Noah's Ark to start over again, unless of course, they fall off the end of the flat earth. \r\nThese braindead idiots would still be believing in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy, if their parents did not tell them otherwise. It is unfortunate that they don't believe their leaders, when they tell them how worthless repuke lyin Willardo, the Mexican Mormon Moron tax evader, bankrupter, draft dodger, job outsourcer and Etch A Sketch Champion is. \r\nMany of them still believe that the earth is flat and that dinosaurs never existed. It is all a liberal conspiracy.

love how democrats re-write history if they would remember the truth about katrina fema had to set-up in mississippi waiting on the louisiana governor and new orleans mayor to ask for help because they could handle it themselves.  but i understand that does not fall into the narrative of how terrible bush was so lets just forget that fact.  remember folks the feds come to states help only after being asked not before.  oh yeah and i am pretty sure that at that time the people in charge of that state were democrats, but once again that does not help the blame bush mentality of the democrats.

As an ordained United Methodist pastor, I've spent my adult life proclaiming the good news of Jesus Christ.  This man may have just endangered himself to the place he's warning others about going.  The only unpardonable sin according to Jesus is blasphemy of the Holy Spirit, not how one votes in an election.  I serve God and his name isn't Mike Huckabee.  It's this kind of inflammatory speech and threats that have been the downfall of Christianity in America.  Mr. Huckabee, you sir do not speak for God nor do you speak accurately of the unpardonable sin...It's time for you to go quietly away and take the other religious charlatans with you.

Umm no, it sounds like a smart and concerned man who doesn't want the country's tax dollars (in the form of relief aid) to get squandared and wasted like so much of it did with Katrina victims and so much of it does with the 47 percenters.  Why do you people (libs) always have to try and demonize everything a republican says?  What, you really wouldn't care if you donated $1000 to help someone out that is need and then reather than spending it on food and supplies or somewhere to live they went and bought a Gucci bag or a Coach purse?  Here's another great example of the 47 percenters...I used to work at a grocery store as a cashier, and people would coem in with their evt welfare money ($100 dollars or so) buy a $0.75 candybar and get cash for the rest and then go directly to the service counter and buy a carton of cigaretts and then walk out the front door and over to the adjoining liquor store and buy a bottle of rum and a case of beer.  Is this how you want you tax dollars spent.  Are you people really so naive?  The man is not the Devil, he just doesn't like wasting yours and mine and his money.

Buying fruit juice - overpriced and unnecessary.  Our bodies don't need 500 times the RDA of Vitamin C that a whole glass of orange juice (or, more expensively, cranberry or grape juice) gives us.  Even a few spoonfuls of spaghetti sauce (yes, tomatoes have lots of Vitamin C) will give us our RDA for only pennies.  If you don't like tomatoes, buying a whole bag of apples or oranges and eating one fruit per day is much cheaper than buying bottles of juice.  Note: the "cheaper" juices aren't authentic fruit juice, anyway - they're just sugar and water.

They each brought a style to the Bond character making themselves into their own James Bond.  Sean Connery is hard to beat since he was the original.  Roger Moore was just ok because he was way too stiff (even though Brits are stiff).  I never saw George Lazenby so I don't have an opinon on him, but since he was Bond only once I gather he was not very good.  As for Timothy Dalton, he reminded me of a guy trying to play a guy trying to play James Bond.  Not at all my favorite.  Pierce Brosnan had an "it" factor and I thought brought the Bond character together which was more of what you could imagine a British Spy would be.  That is until Daniel Craig.  Craig's character no longer has a "Q" for his gadgets and in all actuality he doesn't have any gadgets to toy around with.  The Daniel Craig Bond character has a different feel than the others.  More true to life spy than the secret agents of the past with their grapling hook wrist watch and invisible Aston Martin.  Each guy portrayed Bond their own unique way.

Well the Mormon church was so popular and religion was such a test to people back in the 1850s that they hung ol Joe Smith at the jail in Carthage Illinois.

He really did not read your mind.  Because every thing you see on TV is just trash, so he randomly picked 15 shows and still impressed the heck out of us.\r\n \r\nThe real test for him is to pick 15 shows worth KEEPING!  Now, that will be impressive because I can't even think of 3(I picked the number 3 because every one has at least one or two shows that they watch regularly)!

This country was founded on the separation of church and state.  Men however decide on the women's right to choice on what they do with thier body.  The supreme court is made up of 3 jewish and 6 catholic when the TEA PARTY religion   baptist  prostestant et have no representation   Last time I checked most 3rd world nation have to much religion in their political structure.    Iraq and AFGAN\r\nwith sunnines    shites    kurds     christians    no one gets along    Israel with all the arab nations \r\nIt you took all their children from age 4-12 away for ten years the hatred between all these parties would go away

Read Romney's comments he is not talking about cutting out Federal aid.  He is talking about cutting the waste that is FEMA.  The money is better spent at the local level, not run from some wastefull Federal Govenment group like FEMA.  Federal money would still be given in situations like this.  The difference is the money would be used in local organizations that have skin in the game.

THis is a common policy in the states as well.  In fact 20 years ago you couldn't even wear your uniform off base unless you were heading home or to the base.  Anything done while you are wearing the uniform represents the military and they do not condone drinking and wearing the uniform.  A soldiers uniform is exactly that, A job uniform and should only be worn when working.  That said, I don't think that this bar was out of line.  How do they know if these guys were ON DUTY or off duty and if you change policy once, then you COULD get  troops drinking while on the job.  Kind of a double edged sword for the troops and the bar as there would be all kinds of comments if a bar served a uniformed police man or fireman and they were caught on duty later.

Well.. I am sure Mr Romney will be glad to say whatever answer it is he thinks you want to hear. \r\n  \r\n Governor Romney wanted to let Detroit go bankrupt (his editorial, not mine). \r\n Mr Romney wanted to let home foreclosures hit bottom (his words, not mine). \r\n He says we can't afford FEMA and we should turn it over to the states. (his words, not mine)........   \r\n The Governor is a very dangerous man. Certainly the wrong type of leader for these precarious times.

You haven't released the sex video you made with your mother yet, what makes you think that you have all the facts about the President of the United States.  Sounds like you are part of the problem facing this country today.  Rich people are running this country into the ground by not offering solutions like bringing the out-sourced jobs back to this country.  Explain why it is that the Romney/Ryan ticket has no solid position.  Believe what you want about Trump's offer, but also look at the ramifications of having Romney as the President of the United States....We do not need rich people in office at all!!!!!!!

The President proved his leadership qualities by putting American's safety first, before the campaign. That is a true leader! He is  slowly but surely, leading us out of the 8 year Bush/republican debacle. And with a second term, things will be better. When Gov.Christie, the #1 Romney surogate, endorses the POTUS's leadership, I believe the President is doing a very good job. Brownie is an insignificant fool. He has zero credibility and was a total failure, just like his boss. \r\n Just think where our country would be if we had a congress with republican leadership/cooperati  ​ on. The economy would also have seen a much faster recovery by now because of the President's leadership.

Huck just misses the point. He can believe and practice as a man who's living in, so far, a country that embraces freedom of religion. But does he really have that red phone right up to the Big Man? He needs to keep his personal beliefs personal. I don't want to hang my own hopes on my next life on whatever he says I should say and do and I can't imagine anyone else really does. Oh, and as a sidebar, seems he's fattened himself right back up to his pre-diet weight. What is it again that the Bible says about gluttony?  \r\nThe Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners! \r\nBut we as a country will not call this gluttonous person out for what he is. That's his personal choice. But hey, it is a point he might take, but I'm sure he won't.

Yes, now this is the right time to prove that he has a big heart, his country needs his help after the big storm. Don t say things just for publicity or to alienate our president, the rest of us, the 47 percent.\r\n \r\nAmerica is the only country where democracy really exists otherwise where in the world, a civilian would have humiliated/defied his president publicly without fines and imprisonment or both?\r\n \r\nThe rest of the world is watching us.Those strategies are not going to work because we have his back.\r\nmoney worth more than a presidency? Where is the due respect to the Commander-in-chief?\r\n \r\nWhat is a democracy?\r\n \r\nDon t use our liberty of expression as a tool to convey racist behaviors, arrogance and ignorance.\r\n \r\nTrump could not be able to do that in Africa, especially and many other countries around the world, Latin-America, South America, you named it. Never, in any third world country where freedom of speech is scarced.and/or limited. \r\n \r\nPLease, let the president complete his term peacefully. We love him so much.

once again proof that PA refuses to come to 20th century much less the 21st.  Heck they are not even a state but a commonwealth.  One is not allowed to take notes while serving on a jury and they refuse to allow the same rules for in dependant candidates to be on a ballot as the other two parties.  Heck they even protect their governor from being investigated on his part of the Sandusky coverup.

This used to be one of my favorite shows.  Couldn't wait for Monday night to watch it and then Tuesday night for the results.  Well, now I feel that the results are not done by voting, but are a scam.  The best dancers are gone and the whole show seems to be the Kristi show this year.  No matter what she does, even when she stinks, she is complimented by the judges.  I think that they are all on her side because of her age and her size.  No matter what, she is not a good dancer and makes Maks look horrible.   I used to love to watch him dance, he was so sexy, but now I think his brother has out done him this year.  If Kristi goes on the win the mirror ball, then we will all know that the show was fixed from the start.

there is an effective product believe it or not, which comes in a paste like substance that has boric acid in it.  a company came in to the 'projects' in Panama City, FL and did our apartment complex, which was about 50 yrs old.  before that, they would come in every month just to aggravate and feed the bugs, but this time, new company, new product and new RESULT.  the first day, in one (my) apartment i cleared out thousands of DEAD roaches.  the next day, i cleared out hundreds.  the next day, i had to clear a few.  then ..... IT WAS A FINISHED WORK, hallelujah!  i just want to encourage you, that t here are alot of companies and products, but look for the commercial strength paste with boric acid, and have it applied in every corner, crack and crevice, like caulk.  IT WORKED, and in your situation, it is necessary.  be encouraged, they will not overtake you, the restaurant or the world.  we have the victory!

Romney's charity is the Mormon church.  The percentage for his donations was the exact percentage that Ann Romney said they give to their church.  Mitt's first response should have been to write a check.  Instead, he collects canned goods which the Red Cross said they did not want.  They asked for money to assist those affected.  Obviously Mitt didn't get the message.

Chapter 8 of first Samuel tells Christians that they are to choose a brother for there king or president. To say it does not matter if our leader is Christian or not a Christian is stupidity and anti-Christ thinking. With a mature Christian at the helm HE will seek Gods wisdom and obey Gods will and our nation would be blessed. If we do not have a mature Christian leader, well just look at our country now and you can see with your own eyes the results, or you are dumb blind and stupid.. Our country is falling apart with this disgusting Moslem at the wheel and Romney is not a Christian either but he is better than Husain Obama. The only party that a Christian can vote for and obey God is to vote for the constitution party..

I think he did the right thing by making everyone wait until the streets are safe, but I think which day it is to be held on should be left up to each individual township.

Before saying some one was to early you need to look at yourself. An avg Hurricane is 300 mi wide and this one was and still is a 1,000 miles wide, with the pull of the Full Moon and coming in with the Evening Tide. I don't think getting things going the day before is to soon at all. Now you have me Questioning wether you should be incharge of FEMA or not. You sure missed it with Katrina. Where were you this year in New Orleans? Obama had to get your butt moving because you didn't want to move.

I would like to see Trump release his college and/or passport records from 30 years ago.

Amazing! What Mike Huckabee is really saying is the following, "This is Mike Huckabee asking you to join me on November 6 and vote based on values (in other words vote Republican), that will stand the test of fire." What is he really suggesting? That a vote for Democrats is a vote against God, and a vote hell's fire? Republicans always feel that they have an inside access to God. Their holier than thou attitude reminds me of the Scribes and Pharisees back when Jesus walked this earth as man. But Mr Huckabee absolutely has a right to his opinion and to try and influence the Christian vote.

Star Wars was already destroyed for money. It was never meant to be a kids movie but rather a thriller for geeks. The last three Star Wars sucked. And I don't expect much from Disney. To elaborate my point the first three were much darker, bloodier, and  made in a more conservative era. I have no doubt now that Disney owns it, it'll be full of force wielding bunny rabbits.

Mormon's are not Christians. Their beliefs are not the same as Christians, that is why they are not called Christians. \r\nHowever Obama proclaims he is a Christian yet he twists the Scriptures in the Bible to meet his needs. This is anti-Christ teachings. Or false teachings. The Bible warns us of false teachers, we are to test their teachings to see if they line up with God's word, the Bible. His do not. The Bible is very clear that life begins at conception, and that homo-sexual acts are a sin. Marriage is between a man and woman. \r\nObama supports abortion and same sex marriage and referenced the Bible to support his position on same sex marriage. \r\nI can not judge his motives but I can see that the fruit is evil and a good tree can not produce evil fruit.

Make the fertility doctor who did the procedure take care of them. Maybe it's time he took responsibility for his actions as well. She only had the kids as a way to cash in with a TV show like the Duggers or the Goselins. When public opinion was so heavily against her having the 8 kids, no network would touch her with a 10-foot pole. Now she thinks the world should have to take care of all her kids. Asking her "fans" to raise money to build her a house. She should be ashamed of herself. If she had any sense, she'd get her tubes tied as she is obviously not fit to be a parent.

AA is ****, pure and simple.  AA has never cured anyone of alcohol abuse, has never mended a life, and has never achieved anything approaching success in treating a disease that they made up to begin with.\r\n \r\nPeople don't stop drinking because of AA, they stop drinking because they want to.  Pure and simple.\r\n \r\nYou don't want to drink?  Fine.  Don't.  It's that simple.  You are not "powerless", you choose whether or not to drink.  Alcohol, being an inanimate chemical substance, cannot exhibit the traits of being "cunning, powerful, and baffling".  \r\n \r\nAA is driven to convince you that you are "sick" and that alcohol abuse is a "disease".  You aren't and it isn't.  You drink because it feels good, and that is all.  Once the consequences of your actions outweigh the good feeling, you'll quit, or at least slow down.\r\n \r\nAnd that is the truth.

thank you, but over-the-top is the only way to get some people to think. i also realize that over-the-top can turn some off at times also. i am passionate about the future of this country and the people around me. when i view some comments and pointless made up issues put before us it leads to frustration and anger. the manipulation of our society needs to stop like yesterday. i don,t need the government to protect me here in the us. i have a self protection right by the constitution in the right to own a gun. i can govern my own affairs without the government injections of control. government spending our tax payer dollars in ways that aren,t going to help people, but business. like the bail out of GM. i wasnt ask or offered a choice to bail anyone out. if you build a million car and people don,t have the money to buy them what really does this help? spread the 700 billion across the poorest 50% of the population and bank accounts will open, current stock of cars will be sold, this would create demand and demand creates jobs. it is not rocket science. thank you for your comment. i could go on for this entire data base.

Using the word "squaw" to reference a girl/woman is no more offensive than using "bitch" to denore a female dog.\r\n\r\nThe problem is when words are misused and you can pretty much tell that by context and inflection.\r\n\r\nThe following is excerpted from a letter that linguist Ives Goddard had published in the mid April 1997 issue of\r\nNews from Indian Country (p. 19A) on the origin and meaning of the word "squaw,"\r\n \r\nIt is as certain as any historical fact can be that the word squaw that the English settlers in\r\nMassachusetts used for "Indian woman'' in the early 1600s was adopted by them from the word\r\nsqua that their Massachusett-speakin  ​ g neighbors used in their own language to mean "female,\r\nyounger woman,'' and not from Mohawk ojiskwa' "vagina,'' which has the wrong shape, the\r\nwrong meaning, and was used by people with whom they then had no contact. The resemblance\r\nthat might be perceived between squaw and the last syllable of the Mohawk word is coincidental.\r\nSuch partial resemblances between words of different meanings in different languages are\r\ncommon and of no significance.

It puts an interesting twist on Umberto Eco's "Name of the Rose," that's for sure.  For some reason, the chains and whips don't seem out of place when you consider the early history of the church and how it supported slavery (the very first ship carrying Africans to these shores was called the Goodship Jesus)---and, if anyone doesn't think that chains and whips and dressing in Black has nothing to with masters without slaves subconsciously pining for those yesterdays, likewise neither know nor see a connection of the African Moors leaving (allegedly expelled from, according to some) Spain and the Spaniards beginning bull fighting.

I've never even heard of most of the shows on this list. The ones I have heard of, I've never watched, except for "19 Kids & Counting", and that was only 1 time, out of morbid curiosity, back when it was called "17 Kids & Counting". Somebody needs to buy the Duggar parents a television for their bedroom, and a BIG box of condoms!\r\n\r\n Seriously though, just about everything on television these days is awful. About the only shows I've watched in the past 5 or 6 years are "NCIS" and "House". Now that Doctors House & Wilson have ridden off into the sunset (literally!), the only TV I watch is the morning news (to check the weather), NCIS on Tuesday nights, and the History Channel now & then.\r\n\r\n Yes, I know about shows like "Hoarders", Honey Boo-Boo", "Survivor", etc. There should be a cable channel devoted just to shows such as these, perhaps called "The Garbage Channel".

What is worse than the economic failures of the Obama administration is that this muslim in the WH is very anti American.  Our founding fathers included Christian Principles in most of our most important documents.  They have stood for 235 years and have made our country what it is today.  Today we are decaying from within just as Rome did.  Huckabee is on the right track.

I'm sick of the open use of illegal steroids as tough it's okay. What message does that send to our young impressionable children? We go back several years and prove that Armstrong has been cheating by doping and then finally strip him of his ill gotten victories. I wonder if he is being made to forfeit all earnings that he would have never made had he not cheated. If not then he is still the winner to the tune of several million dollars. It paid off right? Great message. \r\n With the body builders you see them, you know who they are, they are  very visible. Set up an effective means of testing for steroids and all other illegal drug use and clean this mess up. \r\n Why do we condone this activity as long as no one gets hurt? Remember the young and impressionable children? The next user may be one of your own.

I agree with canceling Two and a Half Men, but I don't think it's Ashton's fault. The writers have made Jon's character, Alan, such a pathetic man. He always had his problems with women, and although he was not as wealthy as Charlie, he had a chiropractic practice, even had a hot romance with his receptionist. Stop making Alan such a dirty doormat and the show might improve. I used to watch it regularly but now if I miss it, I don't care.

Why doesn't Romney find something really useful to do.  Like mow his own grass.   But stay the hell out of the way of the Governors and the work the real caring people are doing.   He isn't the Presiden't and is just another tourist and has no business sticking his nose in there.   \r\n \r\nAs for his stance on FEMA, he doesn't remember anything he says 15 minutes after he says it and this is just another case of that disease.   He played deaf to all the reporters who asked him about it while he was doing his so called charity crap complete with Romney video's and anti-Obama t-shirts.  Unfortunately there are those fools that aren't smart enough to see what this clown is, just like they didn't see dubya for what he was either.  Just another Carl Rove/Koch/Murdoch lackey.

Eric,\r\n \r\nDid you serve in the military??  I did.  And once again you have demonstrated that you know nothing of HONOR, DUTY or RESPECT.  War is a terrible thing, but it is a necessary thing.  You say that WWII was the last war worth fighting.  Where would the world be today if we had said no to Korea, Viet Nam, Iraq, Afghanistan??  The problem with these wars is the bleeding hearts (like yourself) and the "do-gooders" that prevent us from winning a war.  I agree the outcome in the previous wars and this current one is not desirable.  What we need to do is fight to win.  We have the stronget military in the world.  Why do we drag out the conflict for years??  I agree this is wrong.  Nuke them and we are done.  Do this a few times and the world will quit messing with us.  Save many American lives.  Don't agree with any of this - that is OK.  Just don't disrespect those who choose to wear the uniform and fight for your freedom.

writers for all reality shows should be fired for lack of imagination. reality shows suck if i want to see how average people react to situations i'll watch Americas funniest videos. I' m very sick of what hollywood thinks i want to watch. Vampire movies, reality shows cop shows,  i like sci fi it seems like when i go to rent movies all there are goulish movies movies with guns shootin evrywhere. and hey Denzel! enough of the cop or special investigator movies. And Nicholas Cage? give someone else a chance you seem to accept any script that comes your way. but do do another sorcerers apprentice movie, maybe 2 more. Scifi without all the murderous violence. Ron pearlman! do more heartfelt movies like "Trial of old buck" or whatever it was called. you like to say God bless you on the phone to friends so do something good not Sons of anarchy or hellboy. everyone embraces Satan and all his works and ways yet very few come up with anything related to God or Christian in nature. Just some ideas. i realize noone will read this in hollywood and could give a lesser crap about what one man thinks. But Good Shows i like were Little House on the Prarie, The Cosby Show, The Waltons, Andy Griffith, Movies include, We bought a Zoo, Dolphin Tale, etc... What ever happened SEAQUEST DSV, AND STAR TREK ENTERPRISE? AND HEROES

Whenever someone says "just a theory" they are demonstrating they don't know what a SCIENTIFIC THEORY is.\r\n\r\nCreationists habitually misrepresent the terms "law" and "theory." The distinction between law and theory is function, not degree of certainty. Laws describe; theories explain. A scientific law is a generalized description of observations (facts).  A scientific theory is a well-supported explanation of HOW something occurs.  The Germ Theory of Disease was, is, and will ALWAYS be a theory, because it explains the cause of some diseases.  But it is a fact that some germs cause some diseases.\r\n\r\nYour science illiteracy does not refute the actual science of evolution.

I don't think you can act "too fast" when you know a natural disaster is coming. The quicker you get out of the way of a massive system like this, the better. Although I have mixed feelings about both candidates, it definitely says a lot about Obama's priorities that he's visiting the battered East Coast and not campaigning in Ohio like Romney. Also, Biden's son is helping with relief efforts. What are Romney's sons doing?

I'm not saying what Birdlow did was right, but this needs to be investigated to the extremes. The officers should have their feet held to the fire and have the flames turned up to the maximum.  Their job was to bring this man to justice in a Texas court of law. This could happen to either one of us.  The people of America have a right to know the whole truth as brought forward by a Texas court of law.  What if the good rev has been doing this for years?  What if every seemingly good deed that the rev done ultimately had bad motivations?  What if the good ole rev is a freak hiding masquerading in a preacher's uniform?  What if Mr. Birdlow had never committed a crime in his life?  What if this was the first time Mr. Birdlow had ever done anything wrong?  What if Mr. Birdlow has been the most careful of his duties to God, but he does not wear a preacher uniform?  We needed to know these things.  Birdlow may very well be the victim here.

Possible to reform FEMA to be more responsive and less of a big, clunky inefficient program that is awful at first response (where the state and private relief agencies are superior) and only marginally better at follow-up help.  Romney wants to give states more control of the allotment of federal (including  FEMA) money so that response is better and more people get better help faster.  I suppose one can argue about methods but the silly partisan "Romney wants disaster victims to  die" type posts here are shameful, ignorant, unhelpful and ....well...kind of pathetic.

Yes, I doubt many people in New Jersey are in the mood. Ironicly Christie is one of the few Republicans whose remarks over the last several weeks will not come back to haunt him in the future. Whether I like his policies or not he is formidable politician.  He did the right thing in praising the president and he is doing the right thing in postponing Halloween. Don't worry Governor some Democratic kids will soap up your car windshield later.

My jaw dropped last night at the  elimination of Sabrina and Louis. What a farce and complete BS that this happened. Sabrina is an excellent dancer, excellent and her chemistry with Louis is awesome. They both were a joy to watch and how they were insync with every dance was amazing. KIrstie, no offense, but she should  have been vote off even before last nights elimination.    \r\nThis is a popularity no doubt and the judges need to get their heads out of their  _ss big time. I don't care if they score to get reactions from the public or not,  this is a dance competition and should be treated as such. They come off as bein the "professionals" and their judging does not leave anything to be desired.  In my opinion, the judges need to take a walk and be replaced with those who can give honest opinions and not embarrass themselves by their ignorance. \r\nPlease someone answer me, did I hear correctly, did Tom Bergeron make a comment about the eliminations for next week be due to the hurricane? Or was a comment made about the election being the reason? \r\nIf his comment regarding next week's elimination was about the hurricane, he is a week too late. \r\nThe elimination process last night should have been postponed for another time. How fair is it that there were some who were not able to vote because they obviously were not able to.  This makes more sense to postpone last nights elimination and have a double the next time, if need be. No matter what, to have Sabrina Bryan go home, very pathetic.  I realize all the stars that appear on DWTS, I do give credit to but seriously, to have such talent not be given the acknowledgemet for their achievements on the dances is not only pathetic but it is an embarrassment to the show.  Not a popularity contest, it is a dancing contest and those who can dance deserve the respect  to be recognized for their abilities.  \r\nIf this makes any sense, I love DWTS and the additional entertainment aside from the competition, however, if the ratings go down due people rejecting the show, due to the way the votes are, from the judges and the viewers, ABC needs to revamp this show in a more  positive way. The voting system needs to change, how I don't know but the stars should be voted upon their skills and not who they are.  Drew Lachey, should not have gone home when he did. Joey Fatone, should not have gone home when he did. However, Pamela Anderson, definitely the first one to go, second Kirstie and then Bristol. Drew and Joey got robbed.  \r\nDWTS, just a suggestion, bring back Sabrina due to hurricane Sandy,. Correct this unfair action and make it legitimate. It is not only unfair to those who were  unable to vote but extremely unfair to Sabrina and Louis.

Down in Texas they call them emojados because the door swings open both ways, me comprendes?

If Romney was a real man and leader, he would MAN UP and OWN UP to his comments on how he planed to make FEMA obsolete.  Right now he has a yellow streak wider than the circumference of hurricane Sandy.  \r\n  \r\nRomney talking to the many devastated hurricane victims is like a  two-timing lover who had cheated (many times before) and once again is looking his crying girlfriend squarely in the eyes as he lies to her that he loves her and that he will never do it again with a dozen roses in his hand.   \r\n  \r\nThis, for him, is still political. Make no mistake about this.  It's has to be because we all know which side of the issue he is on with this.  He will find some way to exploit these Americans in their hour of destruction, loss and sadness as he now has to fake concern and caring.   No?  Then how much caring can he be when we all know that he is not in favor of this kind of government aid to the needy.  What is he gonna do, give half of his fortune away in helping them?  Afterall, they are part of that 47% of which he spoke so fondly.  \r\n  \r\nIf he were president instead of Obama right now and if he had made good on his campaign promise to successfully eliminate FEMA (LIKE HE SAID HE WOULD DO), thousands of people, right now,  would be isolated and financially on their own because in these hard economic times, individual cities would not have had enough emergency funds to aid and support the many Americans who would have lost just about everything. \r\n  \r\nRomney is truly a CLASS act.  Oh, I forgot he wanted to cut classes and teachers too.  My bad.

If you know,you have tunnels and subway entrances going below ground,wouldn't be appropriate to cover,block or sandbag these entrances and if you have a multi-story garage,wouldn't it be smart to offer a cut rate price for 24 hrs-48 hrs for car owners to protect those vehicles,say fleet vehicles, like cabs to protect them from water,or drive them out of harms way,sandbag entrances to major buildings hospitals,hotels,the  ​ ir plate glass windows,a little precaution,could have saved major dollar loss.Let's face it folks,the weather patterns are changing,we should expect more of this nasty weather,when Japan had the earthquake,the earth shifted slightly,expect more of the same,the next time your insurance company might laugh in your face for a claim,because you didn't exercise due diligence or common sense.

From what I've seen written by the msnNOW responders,.....the United States has NO hope.   The liberals, pro-queers, communists, socialists, muslems (all Obama supporters, jock straps) are all in the SAME bed,....typical queers.  And nobody, or very few, believe in God or believe there is a god, even though evolution is mathematically IMPOSSIBLE and to top that off it is NOT even a theory, much less believe God.  The United States of America, the true land of fruits and nuts, just like California.   I think Huckabee's ad is a waste of money, although TRUE and to the point.

'Sports parents' are a$$holes. Not all parents with kids in sports are dumba$$es. My definition of a sports parent is an adult spoiled brat that is trying to recapture their 'glory years' by living through their kids. I feel empathy for the kids and hope they do not follow the example set by their 'sports parents'.

@aquaman - You can lie to most of these people because they are too lazy to check facts. Judge Griesbach is, in fact, a right-wing extremist who was appointed to the Federal bench in 2002 by BOY GEORGE BUSH.\r\nNice try, a$$hole.

Sorry to burst some of the people here in this blog bubble, but a Christian a true Christian is never afraid to offend others  with the cross of Christ and order to cover crosses when he goes to a Christian school to do a speech or do not participate in Christian services because His presence can cause too much attention or makes a mockery of the Bible calling it and obsolete book certainly not to be used for guiding nobody's life we need to use the guidance of precepts established by men which can be easily accepted by all men to establish a better government. That goes completely against Jesus ,A person that says that the black caucus of the USA Congress is not liberal enough because they still believe that Jesus Christ died for their sins, that Hillary Clinton is not liberal enough because she still sings the praises of capitalism and Biden still believes that the military strength of the USA is something that needs to be preserved does not sound very Christian to me. Huckabee is right in alerting people to the fact that what you seem to see  is not what you really get there is a lot of deceit here and shame on those that do not want to research and know the truth.because we are heading to very dangerous times and mistakes of biblical proportion, which can promptly precipitate the persecution of Christians when the not so hidden agenda of other religions are imposed because after all America is not a Christian nation or at least not just that. That is why the Bible, should not be our measure to govern our lives perhaps the Holy Koran and the Peaceful Islamic religion should be a better substitute to lead our lives and the nation. Well perhaps all we can say is God Bless America and stick to our guns and our religion or should we say God Damn America like Jeremiah Wright said for our blindness and our lack of faithfulness to Christ and Jehova God. So shame on those that do think that the political decisions and the content of the character of people is not an important issue and have nothing to do with their true faith and the agendas they push. I warn you be careful be very careful.believe me it is not irrelevant.in the times that come is very relevant and our decisions today can be the avenue to precipitate the persecution of our faith as predicted in the HOLY BIBLE, The planners are counting on our tolerance and ignorance to precipitate that. But of course this is America so you do whatever, Believe or not .....

It is amazing how all these folks can rewrite history.  The only delay on Katrina was not in D.C., it was because the state governments were very slow to request help.  That is the way the law is written.  The states have to invite the Feds in or they don't come.  You will notice that Gov. Christie said HE called Obama, not the other way around, hence the State requested and the Feds responded.  I think the news media has issued a pass to Obama  over the Libyan debacle when they should have been supporting an indictment for gross dereliction of duty. But that is just me.

"The day will come will come when the mystical generation of Jesus, by the Supreme Being as his father, in the womb of a virgin, will be classed with the fable of the generation of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter." - Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826) in a letter to John Adams.  The forefathers of this country believed in the separation of church and state. In the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution not a single word about Christianity, the bible of Jesus. Huckabee is a preacher trying to legitimize his wallet.

I agree with most of this list. Two and a Half Men started going off track when they started putting jokes in referencing drug use and increased the use of it to the point it isn't funny but seems to be an agenda for legalization. This seems to be how CBS tries for ratings. Honey Boo Boo needs to go too. It seems almost abusive to the child and the audience. Any show that takes unknown people and make their lives a show should not be part of the line-up. It's bad enough that we have some stars that started out with a lot of potential and now their whole claim to fame is how much of their life is screwed up and out of control. We don't need Hollywood to add a bunch of unknowns to the mix. It's degrading to stars with real talent that have worked hard to develop their talent into quality works enjoyed by many.

How dare someone think that anyone would abuse government assistance. Seems everyone on this comment page has never seen that!!  This is not an endorsement of his remarks, but I have seen plenty of my taxed dollars going to assistance with people who drive much better cars than I do and who use the food stamps and eat far better than me.  He could have used better wording, but the truth is still there.  I don't mind anyone who needs it getting help, but abuse it and it should go to the next person who really will use it for their needs.

Ford came out a a large number of new models.   Most of compeltely redesigned chassis.  Not a suprise that there are some early production quality issues.  The benefit however, is a dramatically imrpoved product offering that finally after decades matches or exceeds the performance of it's competitors.   I test drove a new Escape and was overall very impressed wit hthe driving dynamcs.  I still found plenty of flaws and it felt smaller and more cramped than my CR-V.  But I really liked the small 1.6 DI Turbo over my car.   Very responsive, although at the cost of low gearing, making for high highway crusing RPM's.   \r\n  \r\nSomething not mentoned in the article is that ALL competitors have improved and the filed overall has narrowed.

I guess comrade Bitsko thinks the definition of leadership is NOT ever being a successful Captain of enterprise or CEO in business, NOT ever being the 70th Governor of our 6th State or NOT ever being the President and CEO of  the 2002 Utah Olympic organizing committee. In comrade Bitsko's mind he thinks leadership is defined  as a person who has NEVER owned, hired or operated a business, NEVER worked in the private sector. NEVER, EVER passed or voted on anything while in the Senate except 'present' on all matters presiding. You're rolling Micky Dumbo!! Your intelligence is really showing!! Clearly defines the mentality and prowess of the left.

""DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co posted a surprisingly strong profit on Wednesday and said it was targeting a return to break-even levels in its European operations by mid-decade after a loss of as much as $1.8 billion in that region this year. \r\nShares of the automaker rose more than 5 percent in early trading. \r\n"We still have a lot of work to do, especially in Europe," GM Chief Financial Officer Dan Ammann said in a statement. \r\nGM's third-quarter net income attributable to common shareholders fell to $1.48 billion, or 89 cents a share, from $1.74 billion, or $1.03 a share, a year earlier. On Tuesday, smaller U.S. rival Ford Motor Co reported a far higher-than-expected  ​  profit of $1.63 billion for the quarter."" \r\n  \r\nThanks Romney for saving the auto industry, ROTFLMAOAYFOOLS

Brosnan was too small physically for the role. Gifted actor, but miscast.  Moore is not a good actor and the scripts were stupid.  Lazenby suffered from his poor acting, a horrible script, an ungodly bad theme song and THE worst ending in the history of the franchise (and one of the worse in film history). Dalton, IMHO, was very good. Craig has good scripts, big budgets for the action sequences and a gifted cast. Connery will always be my sentimental favorite. Great actor. Great villains. Great films

I always invisioned a James Bond storyline kind of like "Never Say Never Again", but with a better story line.  It would star Adrian Paul (from the Highlander T.V. series) as James Bond who after so many missions walks away from MI-6 and lives in the south american rainforest or somewhere remote like that.  MI-6 has a mission that only Bond could take on and they track him down and attempt to bring him back.  He accepts with conditons.  Adrian Paul could totally portray the Connery Bond character with a modern day twist.  Adrian Paul has the stature of Connery and resembles him to a certain extent too.  This Bond character would be a totally right turn from the direction the movies are going now, but it would be a cool idea I think.

The President did what needed to be done.  Natural disasters are unpredicatable and as "Brownie"  found out do not follow the Republican timetable.  The president put responsibility to the nation above politics.  The only thing Romney is on record for is wanting to privatize FEMA.  How many rescue vouchers do you have?  For those of you who live in say, Arkansas and are hit by a tornado try calling Bain Capital for help! Congratulations Mr. President you delivered the goods for New Jersey, New York and New England.  This is the way government should work.

The storm I missed ... About 20 years ago, I was swapping sea stories with a former crew member of the USS Saratoga (CV-60), who told me about sailing through a typhoon during the Vietnam war.  He was on the ship's bridge, and the last wind speed reading they had was 212 mph (that's two hundred twelve, in case you're thinking I made a typo) -- 184 knots.  It was right about then the anemometer departed the ship.  (I guess enough is enough.)  Kind of sorry I missed that one.  Or maybe not ...  \r\n \r\nBiggest I've sailed through was about 70 mph, with 18-21 foot swells.  Gets interesting on the flight deck - enough so that one doesn't flirt with fate by trying to ride out a 940 mb storm like Sandy while "hunkered down" in a house built on a sand bar with 6 inch wood-framed walls and 3/4 inch plywood over the windows.  C'mon, man !\r\n \r\nBiggest I've been ashore for was Hurricane Andrew ... I was stationed in the Keys.  I came out of that one pretty lucky (that the storm didn't turn a little south ... else I'd have ended up in Oz).  (Duty is a cruel mistress.)

Knarf - It was Bush and Chaney who said deficits don't matter, Obama knows he has a deficit and he also knows that if Austerity is used as in Greece and Spain then the middle class and poor will be the ones to suffer. Bush gave us $600 tax back (that's me) but how much relief did the rich get ? So if I got 600 a yr for 12 years from the Bush tax cuts $7,200, how come I am now $60,000 in debt according to the US Debt. Who has my $50,000.

Yes he does. No one gets into office unless he puts them there. That does not mean that he only puts Christians in power. There are many examples of God putting non-Christian leaders into power. Often as Judgement to his people. As he put king Nebuchadnezzar in power. \r\nI can think of many reasons why he might pass judgement on this nation. \r\nSame sex marriage, over 50 million abortions and counting, we have pushed him out of many parts of our lives. But just remember when this nation started George Washington and his fellow leaders dedicated this once great nation to God. They did everything they could to make sure Government could not interfere with the church. Don't believe it look it up.

Basically handing out a death sentence.  So for those who wonder what and why this is the wherefore and if he was but half the man of honour libs try and make us believe him into being he would say such.  Not going to happen folks.  That party is morally bankrupt and any and all of us must pay the price for their spiritual dimness .  Democrats with any honour at all would demand an explaination right now,  today!

Better to be proactive than reactive but it would have to be done right. Thought needs to be put in it and understanding of what you need/want to protect, as well as funding sources. Not everything or everyone can be protected nor should anyone think they can, just how it goes. Whatever the case better start thinking about it now as the writing is on the wall and water levels are going to continue to rise. The longer we wait the more costly it will get and the greater the chance of something major happening increases.\r\nI think its time

I commented on the last thread. \r\n4) Hope everyone is OK as regards the storm-you Republicans out there \r\nwho were hit hard by the storm -get yout FEMA claims in early . If your guy wins it might be \r\ntoo late. Nothing like a Republican  to take advantage of a program he criticizes.

I'm not sure I agree with you that her age has nothing to do with it.  Sometimes, older people take a little longer to express themselves.  And, I'm not calling her old, but she isn't a teenager, thank God!  She is younger than me, so I'm not putting her down for being 60.  That is a plus!  Now, I completely disagree with you that Anything can be summed up in about 3 minutes.  Maybe she was summing up in ABOUT three minutes if she had been given that little extra time.  I attended a meeting where traffic light cameras were being discussed.  I never got to speak because I did not know I had to sign in to talk.  However, had I spoken, I could not have said what I wanted in three minutes.  I had intended to point out the fact that corruption exists when ONE person from the police department determines who gets a ticket.  If it were done fairly, I might agree but with the plan they had and still have I think, other police officers, their families, lawyers, judges, commission members, state officials, etc would not get a ticket while the single mother of four working two jobs to survive would get one.  That is simply WRONG!  Traffic tickets for the most part are selective taxation.  I also wanted to mention my disagreement with professional courtesy, which agaiin is wrong.  If a police officer, not on an emergency call with lights and siren activated, violates the law, he or she should be ticketed as any other.  I know it would cause problems withitn the department but I had a suggestion to handle that too.  If a seperale agency to police the police were created, it would pay for itself.  It could start out small, with maybe one office (neitehr city, state nor county) were assigned per county to watch and ticket violating officers, that would eliminated the 'brotherhood' squabbles that would result from ending the professional couttersy.  Also, as I understand, if an officer is ticketed, no points is assigned against his or her license.  Is it any wonder so many people who won't work wish to become police officers?????  Now, what I've said even here could not be adequatedly stated in just three minutes.  ONe last comment.  If you are going to stick with the three minute time frame, even quantum mechanics should be cut off at 180 seconds.  If you extend that, let the lady talk.

Yes. If police lose the ability to calmly resolve situations without always resorting to arresting the public, especially where there is obviously no criminal intent nor  justification for dragging a person to jail, then they increase the likelihood that the public will react with violence in the future to any similar interactions with them, So actually encouraging people to escalate to more unacceptable behaviors.\r\n \r\nFor the public will rapidly learn, police will not use reasonable discretion to resolve conflicts. When an organization put into place to protect the public can't be trusted to do so, then chaos rules and the public will often turn to itself to seek protection. With anger, mistrust and blame focused on the failing police, regardless how many do try to perform their jobs well. The perception is what affects the masses most.

Not all parts of NJ are as bad as the news reports but Christie is just making sure a kid doesn't accidentally step on a powerline, a nail, some glass ... etc .... besides, NJ needs time to be sure they have 100% traffic control, street lights, walkways ..... too much liability right!  \r\n \r\nPlus, I have to tell you, with all the rain and wind, the ground is pretty soft and loose.  I had a tree fall in front of me ... yeah, I couldn't tell which one it was at first, a lot of noise.  It was big one too!  Lots of trees up here in the NE.  It's not all concrete like some people might think.  Give it a couple of days.

So where are the racist comments?  After all, its not like he's a real criminal.  Just because he beat her up, its not like he killed anyone or burned down houses, robbed banks, he just whipped up on a weak little chic.   Could it be that someone in this world has decided that real values of respect (as opposed to fear that some people call respect.) are still alive and worthy of practice?

There is a fine line between wanting to be healthy and look presentable and being obsessed and looking like a freak. Nature on it's own creates a balance, look at the bodies of gymnasts, tennis players, soccer players, martial artists, etc. Sports where the use of weight lifting is not taken to an extreme and you will see bodies in balance.  \r\n This is merely the opposite side of the pendulum, on the one side you have bulimia and anorexia, on the other this body "building" and the use of steroids. In both cases an artificial methodology has been put to use to compensate for insecurities. It takes just as much effort  and will power to be anorexic and bulimic as it takes for this people to get to this stage.

all you fools go ahead and keep thinking the government will take care of you and your family forever and ever.  I have news for you all:  this country is drowning in debt and the government cannot continue to take care of everyone like you obviously want.  It is called self-reliance, something that you better learn quick.  If you wan't socialism or communism then go live somewhere else.  It is through capitalism, the free market and limited government that built this country.  You might want to start living the principles this country was founded on because as Margaret Thatcher says "the problem with socialism is eventually you run out of other peoples money."  We are just about there.  You better prepare if Obama becomes president.

Alex2, numbers can be misleading.  Accepting the truth of your statement, it could indeed be that 85% went to the 60% constituting the middle class, 1% went to the 39% who pay no taxes, and 14% went to the 1% wealthiest.  The fairness of this distribution  is really the point of the debate over the tax cuts.

Let' hope they can return to Indiana Jones as well without being retarded about it.  I know it may smack of blasphemy as well, but I would not mind a reboot of sorts with a younger actor (not Shia btw).  The actor that was the teenage Indiana Jones in the Young Indiana Jones Chronicals (Sean Patrick Flanery) is not a bad choice or perhaps find an unknown to take on the role.  It would be cool to do a Indiana Jones prequel trilogy that focused on his WWI days as a spy for the Allies.  Raiders, I believe started in the '30s, so there is room to start the prequels in the mid 1910's and work their way up into the 1930's...Hope Kate Kennedy is paying attention to the fanbase a bit more than the merchandising department and Disney.

The fake ones are nothing compared to the real ones showing IDIOTS,who have decided to "ride out the storm", like the ones who stuck it out on the east end of Rockaway and watched 100 homes all around them burn to the ground. One of the first things I saw on TV Mon morning was Chris Christy tell everyone "now is not the time to be stupid". And then of course there was Romney heading up a donations drive for food, supplies, etc for the Red Cross, who by the way do not accept  donations at time of disasters. Way to waste everyone's time, and money. The stuff will just sit somewhere and never get used.

If three white men were arrested and put in jail, would everyone still be thinking that 'she's paid enough'.  Why is it ok for her to accuse innocent men of a crime.  There was a real chance that innocent men could have gone to jail and lost their freedoms and time with their loved ones.  I agree that she is mentally ill.  But she still committed a crime.  One that, had it not been for very good detective work, could have been very horrific for innocent men and their families.  I think she should be evaluated and then legal steps taken if she is competent.

Stick a fork in this sitcom. Maybe the writing was better when Charlie Sheen was with the show or maybe it's the fact that you couldn't possibly replace Charlie Sheen ever. Probably a bit of both. Rest of the cast is solid, but this show's on its last legs. Despite the fact that Sheen was evidently difficult off of the set, it's becoming glaringly obvious that the success of the show hinged solely on Charlie Sheen being the lead actor, front and center. Same principle applies to removing & replacing the front man from a band. This would be akin to replacing lead singer, Bono, from the band U2 and still expecting the same success and the same chemistry.

I have always been a huge fan of the movies and had hoped they would continue the story line.  This Saga could carry on through each generation and remain as creative and as fresh as the original given the right talent and adequate financial backing.  I will wait to pass judgement till I have seen the final project.

It has never been free speech to make deadly threats against another person.  I can not threaten to kill your wife and all is OK unless I actually do it. Why would you even want that to be OK?

What people don't know about that particular Iowa district is that King can pretty much say anything he wants and he'll get re-elected. Western Iowa is very right-leaning and he's running against Christie Vilsack, who is the wife of the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture. Christie isn't even from that area and really spends most of her time living in DC with her husband. She's seen as an outsider and nobody really likes her.

What a bunch of crap!\r\nI can count on one hand the people that brought Sci-Fi/Fantasy films and books out of the B-genre they were once regulated to in the 40's and 50's.. And at the top of that pinnacle is George Lucas! So you ignorant fools that feel like YOU have the right to tell Lucas that HE doesn't have the right to do whatever the heck he wants to do with HIS work, you're idiots, plain and simple!! It's no wonder he sold the rights, he's as disgusted with people that claim THEY know more about HIS work then he does!! If you don't like what Lucas or what any other producer, director or writer does with THEIR work then STAY HOME AND DON'T WATCH THEM!!

"The government of the United States is in no way founded on the Christian religion"  \r\nGeorge Washington \r\n  \r\nI have as much right to NOT believe as you do to believe. You will not force your psycho cult crap on me. \r\n  \r\nAbortions happened all throughout the Bush, Bush, Reagan and Nixon administrations. All claimed to be "Christians".  \r\n  \r\nPresident Obama never forced anyone to have an abortion. If women were having abortions, it was probably because a Christian shamed them feel bad for being pregnant in the first place. Maybe it embarrassed her "Christian" parents or maybe a republican shipped her job overseas. Republicans like to cause problems and then laugh and snark at others when they are trying to cope.

This is not an original for Mike Huckabee that he has put together. He is using the video that was put together by a Catholic based group (cc2w. org Catholics Called to Witness - 'Inspiring Catholics to Live Their Faith'). \r\nThe difference with the 2 videos is: the original is a visual video only with the music in the background and the one Mike Huckabee is promoting is with him talking throughout, explaining the things that are presented in the video. He has changed the wording to say Christian instead of Catholic. \r\nThis in and of itself is not a bad thing, it happens all the time when people like or agree with what someone else posts, they usually repost and may add their own touch to reach their own contact base.\r\nThis just goes to show that the Catholics and the Christians are united on the issues that are presented here in this video. Original video: http: // www. youtube. com/watch_popup?v=D9vQt6IXXaM&hd

I had just returned from working in Italy for six months in 1991 and was taken to a Starbucks by a friend who was all excited about this, "new," coffee place. \r\n  \r\nFirst of all, they have no idea how to make either a cafe macchiato or a cappuccino... AND... they burn their beans. (and they admit it... it's their signature flavor) \r\n  \r\nAt least that was my impression. So... I thought to myself... "This is terrible stuff, never gonna make it." \r\n  \r\nWhat I didn't "get" (and still don't)... You can "MARKET" anything to Americans, and there is NO accounting for taste. \r\n  \r\nBeen kicking myself in the back side ever since.

This is absurd!  The Bible says, "Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God."  Snake-handling is ridiculous. The Apostle Paul was bitten by a venomous viper, but he did not go out  looking for it, it just happened, so Paul shook it off.  It was not Paul who caused the snakebite to have no affect, it was God (because had to go before Caesar).  We have to be very careful not to misinterpret the scriptures.  It could cost you your life, as it did this brother.  I've been a preacher (evangelist) for many years and I would never attempt to do such a foolish thing because God does not require it of me.  I hate snakes.  In my opinion, the only good snake is a dead snake.  After all, it was the snake (serpent) who got us in all this trouble from the beginning.

Let me tell you all something. Yes these men and women take steroids and there is no surprise much of you will be commenting on that. Most of you commenting will be fat and lazy asses that can't even get to a gym. But take note of this.Steroids can make you look like this, but it takes dedication and hard work to put those steroids to use. And like I said most of you can't even get your fat asses to the gym to make some kind of effort to look like this. For the few who do make it, its funny how your cell phones never leaves your hands. Heaven forbid you have to put some kind of real effort. It's hard for you just to even take the fork out of your mouth. Instead you look to the wonder drugs of diet pills, guru diets and train only when you have a wedding and have to fit your fat asses into that dress, a reunion to capture your once glory days or I lost my hair I better give women something else to look at. Keep dreaming and commenting, but look beside you ladies and gentlemen, that's the best you can do. You better pray he or she doesn't trade you in for a newer model; because the way people look at vanity today you never know. LOL

those liberal idiots. Romney doesn't want to stop the aid; he just want to give responsibility to private companies, possibly with very little oversight because government does not work. How stupid can those liberals be? We conservatives keep trying to let them see that government doesnt work, we go in and do nothing and try to block progess constanly and they still will not accept that government just doesnt work.

So reach out to those who need our help & if you can't donate money, volunteer some time or give blood to the Red Cross. When we're united, NOTHING can defeat us.  \r\nBest wishes & we'll continue to keep all of you in our prayers as we move out of this disaster. \r\nC-YA !!!

I do find it interesting that he had time for a press conference and photo ops in the situation room.  It was all over the news that Obama was monitoring the storms progress up the coast from the situation room but it was never once mentioned that he was monitoring the Benghazi Terrorist Attack from the situation room.  He won't even say if he was in the situation room during the attack.  He won't even say were he was during the attack.  There were no photo ops and no immediate press conference.  The requests for help from the seals were denied.  Who gave the denial?  Did it come from the situation room?  Those questions will be answered sooner or later.  Someone or multiple someone's need to be prosecuted.

God also killed the 1st borns of Egypt. God also ordered Abraham to kill his son....\r\n \r\nShow me the verse in the new testament that condemns homosexuality, I challenge you.\r\nJesus forgave everyone, even the prostitutes.\r\n \r\nYou speak of the Old Testament, but as many many people have pointed out, if you are a Christian, you do not follow that book, Jesus came to Earth and died for our sins so that we would no longer have to sacrifice people and animals or kill each other for little transgressions such as adultry or lust. \r\n \r\nIf you quote the Old Testament and use it as a guide, then you truely are not a Christian, because you forsake everything Jesus stood for and endured to make sure that you could be forgiven and have a path to Heaven through Him. I believe Jewish people are the ones that still follow the Old Testament, not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just a different religion.....but you can't be a Christian if you're also Jewish, because you can't worship Christ and deny his existance at the same time.\r\n \r\nYou tell me I am not a true Christian, and it is true that I don't follow my religion like I should, but I say to you, that you are no Christian at all, my friend, so hold your judgements for the Almighty Father, and at least learn the basics of the religion that you use as a weapon to preach fire and brimstone to others with, while at the same time ignoring the fact that you cannot proclaim to speak for God, when you don't even know His word, or His will.\r\n \r\nOpen your heart and see that everyone He created, is equal in the eyes of God, and stop preaching hatred for your fellow man.

Interesting, I suppose it was just a matter of time. I agree with other that this could be both good and/or bad. If done right they could continue the story well, if not and it goes the route that we've seen Disney take in the last few years of trying to wring every last dollar out of a storyline with increasing lackluster and creative films to the point you get some films based on original tiltles that they don't even go to theaters you have to wonder. Disney's track record isn't the best when it comes to things like this and they seem to more often lean towards doing whatever they can to get $$$ regardless of quality. It will be interesting to see how this goes and I hope it works out for the best. I also agree that the tinkering and constant re-releases is not always the greatest either. Does get annoying but at the same time I know it does help get a new generation introduced to the franchise.\r\nI think its time

The question should not be will FEMA be supported, but will FEMA expand (e.g., Obama government controls all things human) or will FEMA be a facilitator of aid rather than an overburdening body of government officials who will decide all things for America?

I can't say I disagree with a single choice on this list.  So called "reality" tv is just plain bad, in any way, shape or form.  Kardashians?  Why not just do a show on selling your self for money... oh wait, never mind.  Isnt that what they're doing already?  They should have milked Glee for as much as they could (ie another season or two with all the regulars in high school) before moving on to whatever this is.  The original cast had a chemistry, this new one doesnt.  And where is Dianna Angron?  \r\n \r\nAnd Two and 1/2 men.  Everyone already knows this show was MADE by Charlie Sheen.  Without him its lost all of its original style.  You know and I know the only reason this show was picked up was to make a point to Charlie that it can go on without him (but really...can it?  Anger Management is far funnier and, oh yea, it has Charlie Sheen in it.  Whitney.  Why did they even pick this show up in the first place.  \r\n \r\nThe networks wonder why their viewership is down, yet they continue to greenlight dribble.  Doomed to fail, they produce this crap . Its a vicious cyle because it makes them (again)  sit and wonder why their viewership is down....

Mr Huckabee wishes to use religion as a weapon... would rather us vote for a NON CHRISTIAN, such as Mr. Romney instead of a CHRISTIAN such as Mr. Obama?? Interesting that this nut job forgets Christians tolerate all, and tolerate all thoughts, on all subjects.. we are by definition a peaceful people, and Mr. Huckabee wishes to start a religious war here on our soil. Mr. Huckabee has no idea what kind of can of worms he is trying to open. Stupid, just sheer stupidity...he simply needs to shut the hell up

Congratulations Steve Staples!  You have won the repeated stupidity in a single post award!\r\nIn your response to my post you stated I didn't believe in climate change.  Wow, how did you get that from a simple question?    I'll repeat the question for you.  If you still don't understand it, get someone to explain it to you.\r\nIf the current storm (Sandy) was caused by climate change (or whatever they are calling it now), what caused the worse storm 80 years ago?  Specifically, 74 years ago there was an equivilent weather event (much stronger winds).  If 'global climate warming change' didn't cause it, what makes you believe it caused this event?\r\nIdiots like the one making that unsupported announcement (and you) are the reasons that literally 50% less people accept climate change now than just 10 years ago.  STOP the hysterics from the idiots like him, and the condescending arrogance from idiots like you, and let's try to be rational aout the situation.  THEN we might get people on board to do something about it!\r\np.s.  You referenced ocean salinity in a different post.  You weren't accurate.  The desalianation of the north atlantic will interrupt the conveyor (heat horth) stream and result in substantial drop in temps in europe.  Rome is on the same geographic plane as boston.  difference in temps is caused by the NA conveyor that will be disrupted (potentially within the next 10-12 years) if the desalianation continues.  Temps in Europe could drop by 15-20 degrees!  And people are freaking over the little degree or two that we may currently be seeing.   Chit has the potential to get way worse, but the doom and gloom screamers have deadened people to reality.         Anyway, the point is :  Dude, DON'T assume everyone on these pages is an idiot and you are the brightest bulb on the tree.  I'm a nobody,but you get some of these people off in side conversations (troll free zones) and you will be amazed at who some of these people are and what they can share with youj.

Of course every idiot republican who has internet has some stupid remark about the Hurricane and the president. Wonder if you mental midgets had that hurricane pick up your double wide trailer and turn it into a twelve pack of canned tuna would you be singing the same song? We can make politics out of anything when it's expedient. Think about what would happen if you had disaster relief privatized? You morons would be filtering your urine through a coffee filter trying to make tea because you had to wait for blackwater to approve your credit application to save your arz. your candidate wants you sheep to believe the states can do it better, if thats the case you had 8 years to make that a reality? Plus, If this was such a good idea why hasn't it already been done. I hope it happens so when disaster strikes you peni$ heads will have to wear grandma's panties like swim trunks and eat your fingernails for lunch.

I would still opt for a FEMA ..BUT...it would be a coordinating council, not an entire new bureaucracy, that would function to organize the separate private and state agencies in order to improve the flow of resources to where its most needed. \r\n\r\nDont tell Mirage Guy, but I am in his camp when it comes to cutting waste, fraud and duplication.  This is a commonsense principle which should be lobbied for by both sides.

I'm just as worried about the FEMA stuff shirts blowing it on helicopters, limos and the most expensive hotels and meals they can find while they sit around and talk to the media about helping like a bunch of wanna be movie stars....  \r\n  \r\nDid any of you people making fun of this guy actually read the full article?  I'm not saying he wasn't a little harsh, but he's right about wrongful use of the funds......and his Gucci bag comment was referring to what did happen after Katrina...so he was speaking from history...this article tries to twist that.  He didn't say no to funding Katrina, he said no to extra funding after they blew the first rounds of money.: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n“Can you imagine in the middle of a disaster to ask for appropriations for mitigating future disasters?” King says. “That’s why I said no on that second round of appropriations for Katrina…because they spent it on Gucci bags and massage parlors and everything you can think of — in addition to what was necessary.”

I agree with Duca, I was in Italy from 2007-2009....America  ​ n Coffee sucks... SBUX makes great frozen drinks, but that is about it.. They truly do burn the beans, hence why the coffee doesn't taste fantastic, just okay.... and also... a Latte (which doesn't exist in Northern Italy)  is a made up american drink., and they don't know how to make a cappuccino. Pouring burnt coffee in a cup and adding an abundance of whole milk doesn't make a proper drink, the right way - espresso roast, frothed milk, in a small porcelain coffee cup. That is the true way.. The Starbucks method is never done right.. I shouldn't be paying 5 bucks for a drink that isn't even made correctly.

That's right! And I think all of you Repubs need to remember what Romney said in 2011.\r\nHe said he would do away with FEMA and let each state take care of their own emergency management issues. Or the states could hire someone from the private sector. So all you Repubs in the storm affected swing states remember that on your way to the polls. If Sandy was 2 week later, NJ,NY,PA,etc,etc, you could be "ON YOUR OWN." \r\n \r\n@ KtWHW - How's that?

I agree with Romney. It is much better served if the States are set up to take care of their disaters.  Case in point. The electric companys don't have to have the government to help get the electricty of millions of people back on.  Just this morning I saw dozens of electric trucks heading towards the east coast from Tennessee.  When disaster strikes other states send all available manpower to help get the electricity back on.  This would happen in ever state if the states had their on EM.   \r\n  \r\nI'm an educator and the worst thing that has happened to education is government starting the Department of Educaton.  This has caused education to become a money grab instead of educating the students.  Everyone is trying to get as many students on Free lunches for the money grab from the government.  If it was placed in the hands of the states they could funnel the monies into the school as needed.  This would take the greed had of all out of the equation.

Mr Un-PC first, phrasing. Bush didn't deny help to Americans in Benghazi, but Paul Ryan did when he cut funding for embassies by 300 million.  Republicans clearly want to gloss over that the lives of Americans have a price.  Evidently that price for Ryan and the other repiublican members of the House was 300 million.  Remember that when you vote.

well, teachers are not suppose to touch the children, so he being the good teacher did not harm him in anyway or he could of lost his job, but it is ok for the children to do whatever they want to the teachers and nothing happens to them.  Kick this kid out of school, let his mother home school him.  He doesn't belong in school if he does these kind of things and his parents should be held responsible for any injuries the teacher incurred.  This child should of known better than to do his karate kicks whenever he feels like.  Bad parenting by these parents.

I agree that this elimination should not have happened - Sabrina is much better than Kirstie, Kelly, and Emmitt, and in light of one third of the country facing natural disaster.  It's not like this storm was a surprise - the producers had plenty of time (at least 5 days) to announce a change for this week.  Have a double elimination the next time - problem solved.  I guess that would mean they might have to cut out some filler (oh my!) to make room for the extra performance next week.  They could even have done the elimination at the beginning of the Monday show next week after giving people all week to vote.  I was lucky that my power stayed on here in Ohio for the show since it was pouring rain with 60 mph winds.  There are still millions of people without power, so giving some extra voting time would have been easy.

I commend Mike Huckabee for standing his ground.  The bible does state that it is against God's law to kill, this means babies even before they are born. Life begins at the moment of conception not birth.  Therefore I truly believe that if people really voted their own hearts instead of what they think is politically correct, more people would vote abortion to be illegal.

I'm shocked by all the ignorance uttered amongst the sentences throughout these comments.  Yes the east coast is in a chaotic state but there is a lesson to be learned everyday with every postive moment and even more so with every negative moment such as this superstorm.  This article is not about Halloween but a mere attempt to shift your focus back onto family especially those little ones that live for candy filled days.  It's how this situation will be handled that will echo in time with your child's memory.  Yes it's easier said than done but nonetheless man has triumphed every time after every catastrophic event.  Here we have yet another catastrophre and another lesson to be learned.  Pave the way to the future with intelligence and resourcefulness not ignorance and stupidity.  GODSPEED EASTCOAST.

It's so frustrating hearing Christians talk as though they are persecuted. Nobody is forcing any Christian to go outside of their beliefs and do something that they find immoral. However, to ban abortion and gay marriage, is a severe encroachment upon what A LOOOOT of people believe. If you don't agree with something, don't participate. Who are these people to change the world? I don't believe in God, so I don't go to church. Simple. You don't see me out there trying to close churches and destroy bibles. Who gives a ****? If you believe in God, let him do the work.

It would be helpful if you learned how to spell Republican before you begin trashing what you obviously don't have any understanding of. Republicans tend to be conservative which comes from the word conserve. I am amazed how Democrats who tend to be liberal, have sphincters that pucker so tight that internal explosion could happen at any minute and tends to express itself as anger. Liberals=Let the tax payers support everyone and everything that liberals think is good. No matter if in this process, the liberals allow the Federal government to take all of our freedoms from us, which is what is happening slowly but ever so surely. That's not for me bucko. I'm 61 and have see so many of our freedoms taken from us in my lifetime and if the Liberal agenda is allowed to continue, we will be a full blown communist nation by the time my 10 year old grand-daughter is my age. In communist countries you have no freedoms, the federal government has all the power. This is why you hear us making so much noise!

Shocked? NO.  Saddened Yes.   Hope that all those affected can get their lives back as soon as possible.   Not surprised at the damages, though.  Looks much like Katrina, here in New Orleans; except Katrina was about 50 - 100 times worse: in pretty much all areas, including lives lost, catastrophic damage and lives simply turned upside down.  I grimace when I see the pictures but realize that this was far from a worst case scenerio for the East Coast and NY city.  Now maybe our country can realize that we ALL have issues with nature and our landscape; NOT JUST New Orleans and the Guf Coast.  I am glad that no wants to "Write Off New York City and the entire East Coast, like many said about New Orleans, after Katrina.  Not surprisingly, most of the people affected are saying they had "No Idea" it could get this bad for them.  Well, shockingly...it can, it does and/or it will. Prepare yourself now for tomorrow, before similar happens to you too.  God Bless the East Coast and U.S.A.  They will get through this and most will be wiser and better prepared for next time. Tough lessons though.  I hope recovery goes well and as speedy as possible.

I have to agree, this show has run its course. It does seem to be getting slightly better but its best days are clearly behind it, and that was before Charlie left, for all those claiming bringing him back would save it or that once he was gone it was no longer as good. It was already on the down hill side with the last couple seasons that Charlie was still there. The first couple season were really good but I think the best were seasons 3 thru 5, when Jake was really at the perfect age and made the theme of the show work. From there it started downhill and it really is time for this one to hang it up. It had a great run and will go down tv history as one of the better shows.\r\nI think its time

I believe its our taxes that pay his salary and fund all the programs they "Government" approve even their health care, retirement etc...I would love to see how and what he has spent our money on. How dare he be so insensitive. I know we are not to wish bad on others but how I would love for him to walk in one of the people's shoes that have had their lives destroyed by this storm.... And I wonder if when we send all the money over seas he asks the same questions although I think if the people overseas bought guicci instead of weapons to hurt our military we may be better off...I think at my age no one could shock me with their actions or words but I must admit this one has me shaking my head.... \r\nI don't live in NJ or NY but do live in PA and was fortunate to only have some damage from the storm and am very grateful to God (oops is that allowed) for that. And pray for all those that have had their lives destroyed I wish their was something I could do..Sorry  for all your losses and hope our goverment steps up as they should.

In keeping with the way Romney has been going I am sure he doesn't give a hoot about the destruction of Sandy.  He'll have to go to his three ring binders to see if she qualified for government help.

Pres Obama owes "Brownie" a debt of gratitude. If it wasn't  for his actions during Katrina there may not have been a blueprint on how to handle such a massive event. He set the standard for failure on an epic scale. For Brown to criticize anyone regarding a disaster response is the definition of chutzpah.

Hmmmmmm, the headstones all weigh less than the coffin, but they are all still in place,and sitting on top of the ground, but, a coffin, supposedly buried 6 ft under, surface above ground? and none of the other surrounding coffins were disturbed? Something's not right about this. I realize that Sandy did a lot of damage, but, I really don't think we can blame this one on Sandy!   No way!  Someone was obviously interrupted "Grave Robber" It was more work than they thought, so obviously, the news media saw this and just assumed "Sandy pushes up coffin".

First of all first-generation illegal alien Gustavo, no hay eslavos en America. There are no surviving slaves of the U.S. Civil War era. They would be 150+ years old which is impossible. Do you not remember history? The settlement was for 40 acres and a mule in Liberia. Yes, America controlled with their military a vast expanse of land in Africa and offered free passage there for ex-slaves who wanted to leave. They founded their own country and we did trade with them but like every other country or neighborhood that is predominantly black they could not abide by a rule of law and chaos broke out. Not to get too far ahead, if you took the deal you "settled" by leaving for Africa. If not, you didn't get ****. Those who remained here and did not pursue higher education became sharecroppers living in a shotgun shack with no electricity or indoor plumbing. Oddly enough, most blacks today are driven to achieve a better life and should be given every helping hand possible because they are legal citizens. Instead, blacks are losing aid to illegal immigrants from Mexico and Central America because your race appears to be too chicken to rise up and fight for your own countries against drug traffickers and other oppressors but you seem to have enough energy to walk up here and drop 10 anchor babies. Disfrute!

He spent out tax dollars on vacations in Europe and a $100,000 SUV.  We in Iowa have been trying to vote him out of office for years.  We may finally have a chance this year now that he is running against Christie Vilsak.  That is about the only good that has come out of losing some representatives due to the loss of population in Iowa and and having to rework the districts.

I voted for Romney two days ago, trying to give a new president the chance of getting things resolved since BO did not do a  good job in the previous 4 years. To me he failed us (because I voted for him in 2008) not lowering debt but increased it, not lowering unemployment  any, not providing affordable healthcare to Americans like he said he would, not implementing immigration reform within a year much less all 4 years, and printing all that money was very foolish our dollar will plummet further in value(up to now it has lost 25% in value from 2008) because of it.

Funny, most of the people making fun of Christie don't even live in NJ. I do, and personally I think he's been doing an excellent job. So what if Halloween is postponed a few days? Better to have that then kids running around in the dark with no power on and trees and power lines still down.

Say I'm naive all you like but the fact still remains no matter what Romney did people like you would say he was doing it for political reasons, so he decided to help people that are in need. Also I dont live in a fairtale unlike Obama supporters the country is going down the wrong direction, bigger government and government stimulas dont help people only increase the burden on people and its sad it take an incident like this for Obama to finally start doing his job. An people still say well he kill Bin laden well any president would and he didnt give to go ahead 2 times before the time he got them. I feel terrible that our country is going down such a state where we condemn some one for doing a good dead by getting supplies.

Personally I think that they will probably do a better job than Lucas did in the last three.  Lucas proved that he stopped listening to the fans a long time ago and decided to make the movies less suspenseful and more "kid friendly".  Aliens started getting less frightening during Return of the Jedi and eventually turned into CGI cartoons with big eyes and ethnic human accents instead of the inhuman sounds they made in the first movies.  He unmasked almost every cool villain and gave him a childhood.  He's like the magician that shows you an awesome trick then gloats on his brilliance when he immediately shows you how it was done.  Disney has had some pretty good films the last few years that had nothing to do with cartoon mice.  I'd like to see what they can bring to the table.

Of course he said that. Up until Sandy FEMA was the poster child of a broken federal office. Think about it. They screwed up Katrina terribly. Oh yes... lets continue to give the feds more power for their broken beurocratic offices and take power away from the states. (lets go against the constitution) \r\nThe idea is to leave the responsibility of recovery to the states as well as charity groups (which are hamstrung by red tape constantly). Once those groups have done what they can, then the feds can step in and help where the state can't. That's the optimal solution. Less money from the feds, which means less money to add to the ever growing deficit. And for those of you wondering, I live in a state that is impacted by this decision. I live in a gulf state that sees it's fair share of natural disasters.

I have been pulled over twice,the first time I was a new driver and there was no way he could have clocked me doing what the officer said I was.  I was also scared out of my mind and was sobbing like a baby, the officer was rude and not nice at all.  When I arrived home I was crying so hard my mom thought I had an accident, I went to court and had to do driving school and got it taken off my record. The second time I passed on officer doing the limit so she pulled me over, she was very nice and I told her that I was doing the limit, she gave me a verbal warning and that was that. The funniest thing was when my little sister got pulled over driving my car and when the officer asked her about insurance she throws her hands in the air points to me and exclaimed, 'it's her car!'  So funny, and the officer was really nice.

We have 8 million people with no power, no heat.  Obama was correct to presume “Sandy” would be a force to contend with.  As for the comparison; you can not compare what happens in our own Country, to what happens in another country.  You are all looking for any reason to hate Obama. Do you always believe every single thing you read in print as the gospel truth; or just when it fits your needs? They ALL lie!!!! Every single one of them lie!!!! Well then I guess I pick Obama’s lies over Romney’s and Bush’s lies any day. Four people got killed!!!!! Sorry, but 6,630 people have been killed in two wars; now that is what really matters. The entire region is a volatile mess, but it is their Countries and not our Country. Ambassador Christopher Stevens knew what he was getting into and he knew the risks; just like a solider knows and understands the risk of war. You act as if they had more security that would of stopped the attacks. Well, when there is a will, there sure as hell is a way; especially if you are a terrorist and that is your reason for living. You all act like you are sitting in the White House and you all are arm chair mini presidents. Get over your self. This incident is minor in the huge picture of the United States of America. Perfidious!!!!! Show me one that hasn’t been!!!!!!!

He served beer to me and my friends when we were 16 years old and we became regulars at the bar.  He let me tend bar there at the age of 17.  I had to check ID's, too.  Two years later he got my girlfriend pregnant (although he was 36 and married with 6 kids) and she left the state to have the baby and gave it up for adoption.  He divorced his first wife to marry my friend and they had 4 more kids and were very happy until he died in his 50's. \r\n Wow!  The 60's.

When it snows, go outside and build a snowman. How long did it take? Not take two buckets of hot water and how long did it take to tear it down? Now try to build it back up. How long does it take? \r\n  \r\nDon't have snow? Go to the beach, build a sandcastle. How long does it take? Now splash water all over it, how long did it take to destroy? Build it back up and how long does it take? \r\n  \r\nDon't have a beach near you, go outside and rake up -all- of your leaves. How long did it take? Now rescatter the leaves across your yard. How long did it take to make the mess? Clean it back up, how long does it take? \r\n  \r\nIt is hard to build something, it takes time, energy, persistence, patience and work. Demolishing something takes minutes sometimes seconds. But the most difficult process of all is REBUILDING something- whether it's the economy or a snowman. Rebuilding means figuring out what is salvagable, and what is not. Discovering what caused the breakdown and creating solutions that will please as many people as possible. The larger the catastrophe, the longer it takes to fix.  \r\n  \r\nThe problem with our society today is this incessant need to have everything fixed instantly, as in yesterday. Cold hard truth is, no matter WHO is in office, no matter what PARTY is in office, the rebuilding process will remain a tedious, long, time consuming job frought with discontent amongst the masses.  \r\n  \r\nGet over it.

There were ten embassy or consulate attacks during President Bush's term. Dems understand you can't stop insane people from blowing themselves up. Carter, Reagan, both Bush's, Clinton, and Obama have ALL HAD TERRORIST ATTACKS. If stopping these attacks is so easy...how on earth did the rapublicans fail during 9/11. W Bush was in office for seven months, had intelligence supplied by the FBI, and did nothing. Benghazi was a mistake, the president took FULL responsiblity. Will it happen again...an attack by nutty islamists somewhere near our embassies even under Romney...you bet. Politicizing it is just incredibly lame.

If President Obama truly has nothing to hide, then he has no reason whatsoever not to jump at this opportunity to do a triple good deed; produce the requested documents and accomplish three things:  1) receive the satisfaction of being able to stick it to Donald Trump and have him put his money where his mouth is, 2) silence forever those that are rightfully questioning his eligibility to be President and 3) do something nice for a charity that might desperately need the money. \r\n Obama thinks he is above reproach, but if our political system actually worked the way it was intended to and in the spirit of being accountable to the citizens of the United States, he would not be; that is the only feasible reason to decline to do this and, as such, is not a valid reason unless he has something to hide.\r\n \r\n The epitome of being self centered is believing oneself to be above reproach and believing you do not have to answer to anyone.  So, while Donald Trump easily falls into this category, he is not the only one.

In the past, Our Great Nation was blessed by GOD because we were founded on and maintained Biblical morals and values. This is no longer the case as this nation now promotes and allows the killing of innocent babies (as did Pharaoh of Egypt and King Herod who was attempting to kill The Christ Child) and embraces homosexuality (the very reason GOD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah). These two acts of mankind (abortion and homosexuality) are among the most DETESTABLE ABOMINATIONS AGAINST GOD! Anyone who believes that GOD will bless this nation while we allow these ABOMINATIONS AGAINST GOD to continue is simply ignorant of THE TRUE WORD OF GOD (The Bible).  \r\n“Christian” means = “CHRIST like”. JESUS CHRIST IS THE TRUE WORD OF GOD (The Bible)….. \r\nJOHN 1:14 “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.” \r\nPROVERBS 29:26 Many seek the ruler’s (political leaders) favour; But every man’s judgment cometh from the LORD. \r\nDEUTRONOMY 28:45 Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep His commandments and His statutes which He commanded thee: JAMES 4:4 Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world (politically correct) is the enemy of God. II JOHN verse 9 Whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. II JOHN verse 10 If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine (THE TRUE WORD OF GOD,The Bible), receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed: II JOHN verse 11 For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds. \r\nDid you hear THE TRUE WORD OF GOD? A True Christian will not even wish “God speed” to a politician who is in favor of abortion and homosexuality rights, let alone vote for that politician! Any self proclaimed Christian or anyone else who desires to be “a friend of the world” (politically correct) when it comes to abortion and homosexuality rights “is an enemy of GOD” and is not being Christ like (Christian) at all!  Anyone who votes for or supports in any way a politician who is against or opposes THE WORD OF GOD “in even one point” (this includes abortion and homosexuality), is a “partaker of ALL of his evil deeds” and in THE EYES OF GOD is “guilty” of performing every abortion and every homosexual act! \r\nJAMES 2:10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. \r\nAccording to THE TRUE WORD OF GOD WHO IS JESUS CHRIST: Mike Huckabee is RIGHT!

The 21st Century,\r\nIt seems almost unbelievable that people in public positions continue with their illogical and totally antiquated pronouncements concerning other citizen's personal behaviour. Are we as a society still in some strange netherworld of 14th century Dark Ages beliefs and distorted perceptions concerning any and all others who might be just a little 'different?' Citizenship in a supposedly open, free and enlightened society should engender and encompass the mutual respect of one citizen for another... even if one does not totally accept the other's personal beliefs or private, (but not illegal), behaviour. It is simply about that individual's inalienable right to take their own particular path for the pursuit of personal growth, happiness and fulfillment.\r\n \r\nPersonally I do not care if someone is straight or a member of the GLBT community. I don't care what race they are, what religion they practice,(or not), or what their marriage or 'significant other' family arrangements are.The bottom line is that they are all fellow citizens and they are simply other human beings trying to live their own lives as best they can and as they see fit and proper. As long as any of the personal behaviour, beliefs, lifestyles or the idiosyncrasies of others do not infringe upon my own rightfull pursuit of happiness, freedom and well-being, I must in good conscience adopt the mantra of 'live and let live'. All of the incessant pontificating against other people's value systems and beliefs is absolute insanity and it has permeated our society to the point of being one of the most destructive of devices ever promulgated against ourselves. Divisiveness has never built anything, let alone a great and free nation. It's the 21st century and it's simply way past time to become a more civil and a more enlightened society.\r\nPeace to all ~

Star Wars was ruined the moment the 4th movie (not to be confused with the first one that was made in 1977) was thought up. \r\n  \r\nDisney will probably do a much better job, so more power & money towards them.

If Disney remains sincere in staying true to the basic storyline without tampering with it in order to appeal to as wide an audience as possible, then things may go well. However, should they choose to venture to make a fast and easy buck by homogenizing the stories so as to make the new films as palatable as possible to the widest audience, the franchise will be ruined, then the true fans will revolt and likely boycott any future efforts (not to mention not count anything they put out as authoritative to the Star Wars universe).\r\n \r\nDisney would do well to remain true to the story and not turn it into a “cash-cow.”\r\n \r\nRealistically speaking, though, Disney did not purchase Lucas’ empire (no pun intended) because they are benevolent souls bent on preserving a certain vision. They spent money in order to make money, and they will get their return on investment one way or another.\r\n \r\nHow they choose to treat the Star Wars franchise remains to be seen…

I am tired of the press calling candidates making horrifically stupid remarks "gaffes".   These are not "gaffes" they are what these people actually think.  \r\n Romney believes 47% of the people are leeches \r\n Romney believes it is not the governments responsibility to help during disaster. \r\n The hard line GOP Senators believe rape is "god's will punishing women".    \r\n STOP saying that "they didn't mean it!"  When they obviously do!

And how about this...when Duluth, MN was hit with the worst flood it had ever experience in the Spring of 2012 and submerged in 10 feet of water and all over the national news did Obama come to the rescue then? NO, of course not.  He swept it under the rug and denied MN FEMA assistance like a coward.  Thousands of homes were destryed, entire roads, neighborhoods, and forests were swept away into Lake Supioror but apparently MN is a nobody state and doesn't deserve national assistance.  Where were you then Mr. President?  Where was your compassion when MN needed it?  No wonder they are suddenly a swing state this election...

I actually see this a very good thing.\r\n \r\nLet's be honest - although Star Wars is a classic - Empire Strikes Back was the best of all SW movies and it was not directed by Lucas. \r\n \r\nAlthough I very much liked Return, it had the beginnings of Lucas's overly kiddie vision that was to come and just kept getting worse and worse with the prequels; Jar Jar, Mediclorians and Younglings Oh My!\r\n\r\nLucas has very simply sucked very hard at each movie he touched since their initial greatness - Indiana Jones 4 and the Big Headed Aliens anyone?\r\n \r\nThere's also the time issue. If Han, Luke and Leia are going to make any apprearances before they are grand parents - they had better hurry up. \r\n \r\nI do not want a CGI Harrison Ford. As we know there is only ONE Han Solo!\r\n \r\nAlso - Disney has been known to leave franchises alone and get good talent - ala Marvel (the Avengers for example) - which they also own.\r\n \r\nAs we all know - there is a great deal of Star Wars talent and content out there - waiting to be tapped. I would actually rather that Lucas stay out of it. Period. \r\nHe got rid of it and made his fortune - good for him - now go AWAY.\r\n \r\nPersonally, I can't wait for Episode VII...

When PETA first started they had the right idea. However, something happened along the way and they really became ridiculous.

They have announced health care costs are UP over $2500.00 . I am self employed and a liitle over two years ago I was paying 876.00 per month for my wife and I plus two kids. I am now paying $ 1186.00 per month. I had a heart attack two years ago due to diabetes that I didn't know I had.. I am perfectly fine now per my cardiologist but when I apply for health insurance due to my current cost I have been REFUSED by all other insurance companies. I am fearful of what my new rate will be this year beginning in January as they have not told me yet. Even when pre-existing conditions kicks in in 2014 they can still charge you a higher rate... it's not one rate for all. All Obama care does is force everyone to carry health insurance but many that do not earn enough money will be supplied FREE insurance thru the government which means some of us are paying "MORE" to cover those that can't afford it. This is where the " difference" comes in... We don't want tp pay for others health care, you think we should, we don't want to pay for your birth control, you think we should. My V.A. Hospital in Fort Wayne, Indiana just STOPPED accepting patients for in hospital care... RUN BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR VETERANS THAT PUT THEIR LIFE ON THE LINE FOR THIS COUNTRY... The government can't take care of them but we need to take care of you ?  NO.....

This is utterly shameful, disgraceful, and full of hatred.  Religion should have nothing to do with politics, one's own beliefs should never be pushed on others.  If you believe in abortion so be it, that right should be afforded to you.  If you do not believe in abortion then have not part of it, but do not condemn people for their choice.   \r\n The acts by society towards gays is the largest Civil Rights ordeal in the United States today.  Affording all Americans the right to marry should never be a state or government choice.  It is a person's choice to marry who they want, without government, state, or individual intervention.  \r\n The one thing America will need to understand in order to grow and prosper in the 21st century is the need for government to quit wasting time on individuals personal choices.  Our government must commit themselves to working through the larger issues threatening America.  Immigration reform, debt, health care, etc., etc. \r\n Until the people of the United States can drop their petty differences and learn to work together without involvement in personal lives this Country will remain off topic.  We the people must stand and vote out all leadership that underperforms.  That goes to say each and every last House and Senate member Republican, Democratic, or Independent must go.  We must place people who are willing to look past individual personal choices and focus on the larger issues at hand.  These problems have been going on for how long and continue unresolved because we have a government that fails to look past individuals personal choices.

I think its pretty funny that the majority on here were screaming that the sky was falling and that gas prices were going to skyrocket.  "Price Gouging!  Government Control keeping prices high! Obama's killing us with greed!" \r\n\r\nFact of the matter is that the sky is not falling, the only thing falling is the price of gas and had been since the beging of Autumn, as it does every year because DEMAND falls off.  \r\n  \r\nIt amazes me how many 'conservatives' out there who supposedly love lazziez faire economics simply can't fathom that demand is what really controls prices.

Donald Trump can't write a check for 5 million dollars.  He is leveraged to his toupee.  He was never going to run for President because his finances can't withstand the scrutiny.  He must work-  carnival barker on a reality show.  The Forbes list is based on self promotion.  They don't  vet what people say their net worth is.....  He is a broke, mortgaged, crazy loser who has given a little under 8 million dollars to charity in the last decade.  Contrast that with true billionaires like Gates and Bloomberg.

The only way I see to end this corrupt farce in Washington once and for all is to scrap the loser congress and let the people vote directly on the major issues; a direct democracy. I can hear the elites and special interests who game and twist the current system crying even at the idea. They have reason to be very afraid of it. In Iceland for example, where their proposed bank bailouts were put to a vote of the people, I understand they voted 90% NO! I believe we would have voted much the same here. I guess the people in Iceland have more freedom than we do.

You are beyond stupid if you believe that Obama and his ilk are true Christians. Read the parables about the goats and the sheep and the wheat and the tares. \r\n\r\nObama, like a false prophet has used religion to advance his own selfish goals - he cares nothing for those he governs. In his selfish world it is all about him - he knows nothing about God.\r\n\r\nThe Bible says we can tell true Chrisitans by their fruit - Obama's life shows no true fruit. Mitt Romney's life shows hundreds of real life testimonies from people who have been around him  - all of whom say he is kind, generous and helps the weak and needy WITH HIS OWN MONEY. He  doesn't steal money from others through taxes to give away to his buddies.\r\n\r\nYou are unbelievably deceived.

You can thank the new laws enacted by Congress and the House, as part of homeland security after 9-11. These laws were enacted to stop terrorist, but at the time some argued that it would only be a matter of time before the authorities abused the laws and turned them against everyday citizen. For example, If you are suspected of being a terrorist they do not need a search warrant to enter your home, arrest you and imprison you for as long as the authorities deems necessary. In this regard they have thrown out the constitution all together.(  who determines what a terrorist is, is another matter)  This is a classic example of the slow progression and interpretation of these new laws, we should just get used to it. Big brother is slowly taking away your constitutional rights one at a time. Next it will be the right to bare arms. One day your going to wake up in totalitarian state, much like Russia and wonder what has happened to America.  In no way do I support terrorist activity,  but I have to draw the line, on my local police being able to enter my home and put in hidden camera's, without having first to show probable cause, and getting a warrant signed by a judge.

I've played several sports and knew many of my teammates' parents.  I honestly can't recall a parent EVER going off like that.  Screaming at the other team or officials was one thing but never ever anything like this guy.  Courtesy and respect was part of what defined a team.  Too bad his daughters will have to experience the inevitable ridicule and embarrassment.  Way to go, idiot.  Mr. Kasik is not a sports parent.  He is a psycho nut job who should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  (IMHO)

The economic hit came from an economic slow down after 911.  The slow down could not support the outta balance home pricing do to shady accounting practices entered into under Clinton's administration. Four years ago we witnessed the result of a calculated move on the Dems part when in October 1999 banks, lending institutions and savings and loans were deregulated which unleashed a firestorm of stupidity on the economic base of this Country, and on the part of every American who participated in the "every American deserves a home" mentality. I watched this idiotic approach to expanding the American Dream to those who could not afford it nor had the fortitude to work hard enough to ensure it and knew exactly how it would end up.  \r\nWhen Bush attempted to stop the improper accounting practices early in '01, the heads of the house banking committee (barney frank) and the Senate finance committee (chris dodd) who MANDATED that 20% of all loans HAD to be bad loans, I mean 'sub-prime'!   This was mandated by the federal government.  Put the blame where it belongs.  This caused the crash.  Under Obama we have gone from 23 million food stamp recipients to 46.7 million.  \r\n  \r\n23 million Americans need a job.  This administration is doing nothing to create an environment for business to flourish.  The government cannot create jobs without taking it out of the taxpayers pocket first.  The jobs have to be non-governmental jobs private industry, small businesses, existing businesses who are not afraid to expand and invest in America again.  Sir place the blame where the blame belongs the tax and spend we will take care of everyone mentality of the Liberal mindset.

As usual, not enough information to find out what led up to cuffing, but city council meetings are frequently taken over by these loudmouthed morons. MSN is trying to display as the those mean old cops beating up on Granny. The cops were following procedure, you always cuff someone who is making a scene or who won't obey a direct order. Doesn't look like any over reaction on the cops part. They are quietly waiting for her to finish her speech.

I'm not going to disagree with you, but that wasn't what this 'article' was about, it was about, as always, liberal rhetoric and an attempt at creating MORE contempt for anyone and anything conservative and ignorant people eating up the bullsh*t 'news' as if it were actual. It's disgusting and humorous at the same time, I mean, just read the comments...how many of these people actually put the entire statment into context before jumping to conclusions and writing hateful comments about ALL conservatives? NONE, because that is all ignorance is made up of, assumptions and certainly never fact. \r\n \r\nGood day

I agree with "Someone" on the Benghazi attack.  New information came out today that a cable went to Hillary Clinton in August stating that the Embassy wasn't safe, that terror cells were surrounding the embassy and they (in the embassy) were not feeling safe and asked for more security.  Obviously the White House and Clinton did nothing and people died. But, more importantly, Obama is trying to cover this up and brush it under the rug until November 15th.  The main stream media is not reporting on it.  Only Fox news.  Even Facebook sensored the information that was put on Facebook by retired Navy Seals regarding the Benghazi attack.  Wow, wow.  We are already in a government, nazi controlled state.

You got it partly correct, Ben. The President audited FEMA and was able to reduce it's overhead by $1 Million. Romney's business record doesn't "reduce". He buys, cripples then sells it off in pieces. Once liquidated, he gives the personnel the boot and his team of cripplers-- bonuses. We don't need or want a Romney.

I don't believe ten days from now any of this will have the effect on the market it will have on the folks affected in the area.  They will spend their money rebuilding but will have less for Christmas and smart phones, vacations and eating out.  Look for Apple to continue to slide.  Anybody really believe it could hold that value?  Marginal buying in the short term in my opinion for Apple.   I believe this event will have little effect on the election.  Romney still leads but marginally and the media will atempt to raise expectation without success. I have spoken many times about the unsuspecting events that any person and country should expect in life.  These kind of events always occur just never let us know ahead of time where and when.  We will undoubtedly see this as a great excuse to print more money and continue to devalue the dollar.  The one point I feel needs to be made is thus.  At the height of the  Housing bubble many gave into the urge and drank the Kool Aid that it just might go on forever.  We now know that was foolhardy.  Just the same many now believe we have escaped massive inflation even in light of massive money printing.  This will prove to be just as false in due time.  15% to 20% annual inflation should start sooner than later.  Only the time frame is in question.  JMHO

Tom Cruise is very good at this role, but that is his limit.  He is not believeable at much else.  You always see 'Tom Cruise' the man in his other roles over the years.  You don't really see the character he is playing.  This is a problem for him.  I will say though that in the movie Valkyrie he was outstanding.  I would put him up against any other good actor of today in that role.  I think he really likes to work in the movies, but his choice of roles over the years has been questionable.  Maybe what he needs is another Jerry McGuire to jump start him.  The only problem is those roles are rare.  I would give him some sage advice though:  Get your personal life under control and stay away from the tabloid media.  It has really hurt your reputation.

Too bad he has turned into a right wing nut. The man would have made a great candidate for president. He seems to just want to go down in flames with his crazy ideals.  I feel sad for you Huckabee

tdewj - Are you as naive as you sound?  Of course Romney was campaigning and trying to pass it off as a 'drive for flood assistance'.   Any half-wit could see through that ploy, as any half-wit could count all the flip-flops and lies Romney spouses on a daily basis.  His latest lie about 'Chrysler moving all jobs out of Ohio' could come back and bite him, since most serious voters in Ohio know the truth about Chrysler and Romney's opposition to saving the auto industry.

Sharon,  I'm a Christian... I don't appreciate Huckabee's view or his ridiculous statement. That's not Godly wisdom, that's mans foolish way.   P.S. .Do you actually believe Huckabee is always on the right side?  Answer: Not him, not any man.  Whew!!!  I'll pray for you if that's OK. Not as one partisan to another but as one brother to a sister(in Christ).

Obama is just playing politics. This is a good campaign ad without spending any money. Free coverage. He has never stopped campaigning or never started telling the truth. The best thing he can do is stay out of the way while the states deal with cleaning up the mess. But he'll be on the ground tieing up valuable resources to protect him while others are still suffering.

Disney has so much money Do any of you know that the marvel and avengers movies were Disney they own the rights to them and made good movies I think they will do good with star wars but not a continued story of luke leia and han they need new blood farther down the skywalker blood line and that will be better way to go I think

Tom:  I Thank you & your family for your service to our country.\r\nI think I see the point Major Tom is making here; being a "Real American" doesn't necessarily mean being a Christian, claiming to be a Christian or simply towing the party line regardless of the relevant issues against your conscience.  \r\nIt's obvious that there are a lot of good Christians with the best intentions, but a lot of them cannot put up an effective mental defense against a lifetime of manipulation & religious indoctrination; that's NOT freedom!  \r\nMike Huckabee & his conservative constituents have unapologetically & willfully violated the boundary of church & state by using their faith as a tool to gain popular political support so they can push their conservative agenda & our country into a greater economic collapse.  If they had any merit as statemen they would encourage the American people to read the information themselves & make up their own mind.

I just attended a public hearing in which each person, either for or against, was given 5 minutes each so everyone who wished to make their point could do so.  Several went over their allotted time and forced the meeting to go way past the regularly scheduled items needed to be dealt with.  So, the lady should have been escorted off the podium and if she was resistant to the moderator and the police then cuffs should have been used to keep her from perhaps lashing out at the cops and getting herself conked on the head with a baton.\r\n\r\nShe was out of line!   Cops just did their jobs as safely as they could!

Obama is just a face in front of the Liberials and Muslins behind him,,, Think about...stop and think of all this things that have happened and what Obama wanted to pay attention to and the things he has changed that weren't in the interest of America.. Bowing to Arab leaders, Never taking His wife to those countries, not letting the Day of Prayer happen in the Mall in Washington, but letting a million Muslims on the mall...to pray.. taking the crosses down in Arlington cemetery.. won't let the proud Words of In God We Trust stand at a college while he speaks... when He talks about being a Christian his lips curl in distain.. have you opened your mind up at all to who this man isn't.. Even his Social Secruity Number isn't Obama's ..doesn't that strike you as something is wrong with this Man.. if it doesn't, what country do you want??

You have to wonder why RTP always likes to continually bring up MP. He is the only one that keeps his name alive. That is why I am certain he is MP. The two characters are inseparable. Not only that but while I was being harassed by RTP he quickly changed his avatar to a picture of him mugging the camera then quickly reverted back. Case closed. He does not live in California. He tries to sound like a Californian, but to true Californians you can easily pick out wannabes. \r\n\r\nI agree Medal - This all started because I said, "be careful giving out personal info online" and RTP(RolyPolyTrolly) jumped all over me. I said it on 2-differnet chains and they happened to both be women RTP was phishing on. \r\n\r\nSince then he won't leave me alone. Crying I am following him but as you can plainly see it is hi who keeps following me and now Maggie, because she agreed with me. The guy is a whack job and treats the MSN women like they are his property and then flips if the question anything and asks like a jilted boyfriend. I say everyone ignore him and let him find fresh meat. But keep in mind I will always post: Be care posting personal information online - Especially if I see someone phishing!

you know what kills me, that Huckabee wants to take my right to choose away. It is his opinion on  whether it starts at conception and he cant carry a baby.  I am a christian and I feel I have no right to tell someone else what to do about their body, period.  we think we will know what we would do if we became raped but we dont.  There are 180,000 rapes a year and out of those 40% result in pregnacys this includes children that are raped and incest.  If it were your child or you only you can make that choice and you have no one to answer to but God not anyone else.  Not even God changes our Will.  But they want us to believe by shoving Gov down our throats for their reason makes it ok and not big Gov.  My birth control should be paid for  through  my insurance that I pay for just like Viagra is covered.  It is not different than someone being on disability and they still are having sex and has birth control who do you think pays for that, we do. And I have no problem paying for it because i never know when i may have to get the same help, no of us know.  Instead of trying to go after the women and her body how about going after these men that are committing these rapes year after year and find a solution there.

But of course when a tornado hits a midwestern(red) state like Iowa nobody ever uses federal aid money inappropriately. That would only occur in blue states with minority populations. Sad to think that a Congressman thinks so little of others to always assume the worst in people. There will always be people that use aid in a fashion we find wrong but that doesn't mean it should be witheld from all.

Huckabee was only addressing Christians, not everyone! \r\nIn the past, Our Great Nation was blessed by GOD because we were founded on and maintained Biblical morals and values. This is no longer the case as this nation now promotes and allows the killing of innocent babies (as did Pharaoh of Egypt and King Herod who was attempting to kill The Christ Child) and embraces homosexuality (the very reason GOD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah). These two acts of mankind (abortion and homosexuality) are among the most DETESTABLE ABOMINATIONS AGAINST GOD! Anyone who believes that GOD will bless this nation while we allow these ABOMINATIONS AGAINST GOD to continue is simply ignorant of THE TRUE WORD OF GOD (The Bible).  \r\n“Christian” means = “CHRIST like”. JESUS CHRIST IS THE TRUE WORD OF GOD (The Bible)….. \r\nJOHN 1:14 “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.” \r\nPROVERBS 29:26 Many seek the ruler’s (political leaders) favour; But every man’s judgment cometh from the LORD. \r\nDEUTRONOMY 28:45 Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep His commandments and His statutes which He commanded thee: JAMES 4:4 Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world (politically correct) is the enemy of God. II JOHN verse 9 Whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. II JOHN verse 10 If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine (THE TRUE WORD OF GOD,The Bible), receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed: II JOHN verse 11 For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds. \r\nDid you hear THE TRUE WORD OF GOD? A True Christian will not even wish “God speed” to a politician who is in favor of abortion and homosexuality rights, let alone vote for that politician! Any self proclaimed Christian or anyone else who desires to be “a friend of the world” (politically correct) when it comes to abortion and homosexuality rights “is an enemy of GOD” and is not being Christ like (Christian) at all!  Anyone who votes for or supports in any way a politician who is against or opposes THE WORD OF GOD “in even one point” (this includes abortion and homosexuality), is a “partaker of ALL of his evil deeds” and in THE EYES OF GOD is “guilty” of performing every abortion and every homosexual act! \r\nJAMES 2:10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. \r\nAccording to THE TRUE WORD OF GOD WHO IS JESUS CHRIST: Mike Huckabee is RIGHT!

The State Stores should simply not exist.  Liquor stores should all be privately owned and run.  But the state is making too much money, they will never be willing to give that up.  The debate has been going on all my life, and I'm sure it will outlast my grandchildren (which I don't even have yet).

If only Mitt had morals. he has shown he does not.

Like aactionarray said, coffins are placed in vaults when they're interred. Pretty much you're putting a box inside another box and sealing it up. The job of the vault is to keep the casket from being crushed by the weight of the earth covering it so you're gonna have a little room between the concrete vault and its cap and the coffin itself. When a lot of water is introduced to the ground in a short period, the water is going to fill the gap between the vault and the coffin and the coffin can become dislodged and pushed to the surface with the extra water looking for a place to go. Then you've got high winds and rain that are gonna act like a pressure washer and receding flood water that can wash mud off of concrete caps and steel caskets. When you have conditions like that, mud isn't going to stick and the coffin isn't going to look like its been in the ground for years.

BTW... Chrysler's Sergio Marchionne responded today to Romney's claim that he was moving jobs to China. Marchionne said that indeed, a Jeep plant is being built in China for a Chinese version of the Jeep Cherokee. It will be managed by a special team from Detroit and will not diminish or interfere in the Detroit business. He also said that Alfa Romero is completing plans to introduce a car in America and intends on utilizing existing facilities to do so. Basically... his position involves the cost to ship the product to the buyer when it has a motor and wheels.

It is always interesting to me how when someone disagrees with President Obama, there is a large contingent of people who will automatically cry racism, but when it's pointed out that 96% of blacks voted for Obama, it doesn't seem to be an issue... \r\nIf all your wonderful ideas were so valid, why didn't Obama make them happen in his first two years when he had a majority in both houses of congress... \r\nIf it makes you feel any better, I would have voted for Condaleeza Rice for any political position, including president.... \r\nBy the way, Abraham Lincoln was a Republican...

His timing and choice of words might have been off, but the sentiment depicts an accurate fact. I remember Katrina people getting their FEMA Visa gift cards and then going to Houston's Louis Vutton store and blowing the money on new purses. Of course, this means that they required more assistance because they needed shelter, food, clothing, etc.  And, as you may remember, many survivors of Katrina didn't want used clothing. Rigghhhhttt....50% of the working people I know shop at thrift stores. If you work hard, you don't want to see people wasting the tax money that you contributed. It's one thing to help those who help themselves. It is a completely different story to give to  those who just want handouts.

I already DO feel free to comment on your post. I have already done it twice ma'am, without further permission. And you ABSOLUTELY don't stand by your posts, which is why you keep changing them. Like when you posted  "let that man comment on anything we wants too!" And after you were called out on your childish grammar you changed it to  "let that man comment on anything he wants too!" Did you not? And you ABSOLUTELY reworded this post as well, so you obviously ARE concerned with how you are viewed on here. As to a childish game, there is nothing more CHILDISH than calling an entire state's worth of people 'Idiots.' My brother, niece, and sister in law live there, and based on the grammar and context of your posts, I would say you are a much bigger idiot than any of them.

So you object to the President holding a preparatory press conference one day in advance of an enormous storm making landfall.  What, exactly, would be the right time?  In the middle of the night, a few hours before landfall, when nobody's awake to hear it?  Twenty minutes ahead, after everybody has had a chance to get caught in a flat footed panic and there's no time to do anything?  Can you, personally, even predict the landfall of a storm accurately, to the hour?  If you can, you must be God Himself.  Anybody who criticizes someone else - in this case, the President - for doing something that cannot objectively be done in a better way, obviously is just a hater with nothing valid to criticize.  The problem isn't the President.  It's them.

I was locked up a while, I once saw an old **** like this come to our ad-seg unit who liked to shoot his mouth off.  Like this guy, he wasn't getting the message and kept shouting and setting off the place causing disruption among the guards and us fellow occupants. Needless to say, this old bastard got the message stuffed in his mouth with an oil sock, tied to his bunk with towels, and his figers burned with a cigarette lighter (contraband) until the guards came in an ruined the "re-education"   Moral of the story, if you go around shouting out certain things like this ****, bad things are going to happen.  This guy better keep his mouth shut, my adivce, just saying, he's headed to place that will shut it for him if he doesn't get smart in a hurry. Lock up is designed to keep the idiots off the street, but not necessarily off of eachother.  I still wonder today if the guards kind of took their time??

Hurricanes and tornados are terrible acts of nature, but we already know this.  Why then, do we use taxpayer money to send to these lavish coastal communities to repair their broken wonderland?  Every year we send millions to the millionaires to fix their problems.  I would rather see fema money spread out throughout the country to feed the people that NAFTA put out of work (and filled many pockets on the northeast coast).  Don't build on or near the coast unless you can afford to repair after every event -  the cost shouldn't trickle down to the taxpayer.

Idiot...\r\n\r\nStraddling the line between fall and winter, plenty and paucity, life and death, Halloween is a time of celebration and superstition. It is thought to have originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, when people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off roaming ghosts. In the eighth century, Pope Gregory III designated November 1 as a time to honor all saints and martyrs; the holiday, All Saints’ Day, incorporated some of the traditions of Samhain. The evening before was known as All Hallows’ Eve and later Halloween. Over time, Halloween evolved into a secular, community-based event characterized by child-friendly activities such as trick-or-treating. In a number of countries around the world, as the days grow shorter and the nights get colder, people continue to usher in the winter season with gatherings, costumes and sweet treats.\r\n\r\nhistory.com/topics/h  ​ alloween

Disturbing, not surprising.  I am a Christian and NO ONE, no one, not my pastor, not the Pope,, has the right to tell anyone else how to vote and/or admonish Christians and try to intimidate using Christianity as a weapon.  The great thing I can report, at least there are some Christian laymen who know how to encourage people to get out the vote and not hurl accusations and call themselves Christian leaders when obviously all they represent are politics and not Christianity.

I guess it is easy for Mitt to say he would get rid of FEMA...  He has houses all over the country and the money to go anywhere in the world and stay as long as he likes.  The rest of us don't have that option.  Our homes are our largest investment.  We have spent years of life and work paying for our homes, doing renovation to them, and growing memories in them.  For us, losing our home or not being able to live in it, would hurt us in so many ways.  For someone like Mitt, it is just an inconvenience...

What most people don't realize is that the interpreter is giving not only the literal meaning, but providing context for the audience.  Her facial expressions are exaggerated not because of the immediate audience, but because she realizes that her face will be very small on the TV screen  and to those furthest from the podium.\r\n \r\nAnyone who has ever had the misfortune of being in the front row during a live performance on Broadway will understand.  It seems overdone, awkward, and grotesque.  The facial expressions are grimacing, mugging charicatures of real emotion.  It must be so for the benefit of those furthest from the stage, who can see it less well.  The exaggeration is for the back row, just like the speaker towers at a music concert.

Yes he probably did. He actually had got away with it but his "accomplice" had a change of heart and felt guilty about what they had did and decided to go to the police and tell them what they did. After finding the body, they brought it to one of the rooms they rent above their bar (where this alcoholic was apparently living anyways) and put him in his bed. Then waited till after the weekend rush to report finding him dead in his room. \r\nThose 'super intelligent, good guy cops' never figured it out until one of the people involved told them.\r\nIt's just like them too, they must have been embarrassed because they went for the maximum sentence for this heinous "crime": 15 months in PRISON. Prison, can you believe that, for having absolutely nothing at all to do with this guys death. I'm not saying what this guy did isn't wrong or anything but it definitely doesn't call for prison time. Maybe, maybe at the absolute most, 3 months in jail with work release. With 'good time' he would have been out in 60 days. That I think would have been probably too much but still, 15 MONTHS??? I thought it was only in the United Policed States of America that unfair and unjust prison sentences were given out. But it is nice to know that we aren't the only country out there that violates it's citizens constitutional rights...

@Diskerd Yeah money seems to ruin a lot of stuff.\r\n@Humble much I know what you mean with the original 3.  I just bought the 3 original on VHS so I have them and can reflect back on what I grew up watching.  Lucas did imagine this whole world, so without him, no Star Wars.  He remade the original 3 because he didnt have the tech to do what he wanted to back then. Fortunately The clone wars on Cartoon network does a good job with the story.  I just dont want Disney to instil "their" values to the Star Wars Expanded Universe.  Just doesnt sound like a good idea.  But Im with Diskard, selling out sucks.  Its the last move to show Lucas is truly done with Star Wars.

As long as Disney understands that it is about the story and not the special effects, they should do well. (Ok, the special effects are important, but it won't work without the former.)

Technically this show shouldn't have gone past the pilot but eh, what can you do.  This is actually one of the best lists I've seen online.  I don't disagree with any of the shows listed and I"m glad msn had the guts to go against popular thought and put shows like Two and Half Men and How I Met your Mother on the list.

I know where he's coming from. Miami residents would take FEMA money and blow it on all kinds of luxuries. Some people even detroyed their property more than what the storm would do in order to get more money. That's why Miami has so many high insurance rates and such, unfortunately. Yes I know it's not New York (Jersey) but the bad rep of people abusing FEMA is already established.

Thank you "Brownie" for your expert  opinion.  Your consistency in timing alerts is admirable.  I guess if it worked so well during Katrina, then it should suffice for Sandy.  I think you must have spent too much time in one of them FEMA trailers that were contaminated and it pickled your brain.  Your 15 minutes were up long ago, please fade back into obscurity.

I Feel that it is important to take care of your town, first, and your fellow neighbor and anyone else you can help.

@Harley mom.....Name calling???

I would add that one thing is certain when people use that phrase, they have no clue as to who or what the Taliban is and does, other than their party line mantra. \r\n Using that phrase is just as ignorant as those on the right calling Obama a socialist. Your are right, there is a complete lack of civility in these debates.  If you truly want respect to be tangible in the political arena, you might want to look in the mirror as a good place to start the reformation.

Because the shameless liberals chose to blame Katrina on President Bush, Obama now finds himself in the same position under similar if not worse circumstances. The fact is, that neither Bush nor Obama are responsible for anticipating the size, scope and landfall of a storm. Of course the vilification of President Bush over Katrina has left a bitter taste in the mouths of many. Prior to Katrina, the POTUS was not in charge of disaster response. \r\n \r\nSo, here goes!\r\nWhat do you mean too soon! Obama was too late! Why didn't he anticipate landfall in Atlantic City?\r\nWhy didn't he use stimulus funds to build better levees? Why didn't he personally force everyone to leave when they were told? Why are the lights still out? Why hasn't he found all the missing yet?  Yada, yada, yada.

HAHA! Here's his M.O. it never changes. He is trying to get us to track him down and post something on the chain where he is currently stalking(all women of course). Then he can play the victim card to them. He likes to run up pull a pigtail and then run. Hopefully more will heed the warnings and watch for him. Sadly he latches onto so many women here it is something he will always do. I just feel bad for his wife and kids...dang, I keep forgetting. Plus good luck when he uses 20-differnet characters. \r\n\r\nI love when he fights with himself. Can you only imagine what the cellar he lives in smells like. It must put lotion on it self. As he does the Buffalo Bill dance in the mirror.

As a massive fanatic of Star Wars, dedicating his life to collecting only Star Wars everything and desiring to work for ILM; I was very disappointed as was everyone else with the prequiles. the "special edition" was awful and should have never been messed with at all.

Disney has released some total dogs recently. They would be better off starting clean with something like Halo or Borderlands and getting young kids excited. The problem with Star Wars is kids see them as old peoples movies, and old people will want an Ep's IV-VI re-hash, but won't tolerate any deviation from the established Star Wars universe. But time and tastes have moved on, and Disney won't be able to pull it off. They will do something stupid like another Annakin (kid or adult), and another Jar-Jar and underwater monster scene and ruin the movie. John Carter had real potential, but they made it stupid, Jones 4 was ruined by La Boof and pointless sentimentality, and Mars Needs Moms was a bit creepy. Kids want exploding heads and babes in wet t-shirts, and Disney can't do that.

Brown is a mealy mouth piece of **** . He has zero room to armchair quarterback a monday night football game let alone a ****ing federal response to a hurricane! I loathe Obama and Romney ,but at least he did something other than stand around whacking his pud with a moronic look on his face which is essentially what Brown and Chertoff did . I personally think they should have been thrown in prison for malfeseance and gross dereliction of duty along with Bush. They (all 3) had absolutely no business being in charge of the well being of others . Not one previous job held by any of them lends them any experience or credibility. If they had been stupid enough to set foot in NOLA since, they would be in a world of hurt they cannot even imagine. I really do not like them but .....there are fellow citizens of NOLA that HATE them with every fiber of their beings and would not hesitate to attempt to fill a void left by Katrina with their blood.

I didn't know when we moved here, but swimming is a big thing in this area. I inadvertently became a swim dad.  I was always excited, but always low key - no shouting, nasty remarks, etc.  Even most of the noisy parents were pretty polite.  In about a decade of swim meets, I only remember a few times when parents were outright rude - and one time when a dad made threats.  I'm not a fan of zero tolerance, but for behavior of "parents" and particularly for threats or actual violence, that's what's needed - and no hesitancy to call the cops.

FEMA: Federal Emergency Management Agency.  \r\nAMEA: American Military Emergency Assistance.\r\n \r\nWe don't always need an Agency whose sole function is Emergency Management. We do need some functional assistance in emergency situations. I dealt with a Business Proposal once that focused on Emergency Preparedness by maintaining certain generalized equipment where it might see regular or frequent use, thereby be updated by necessity rather than antiquity. The Phase II and III equipment is regionally based along with trained personnel. The "team" the entity put together all had military and/or emergency experience. It seems to me that we would be wrong to eliminate FEMA but more fiscally responsible to incorporate it as AMEA into another fiscal area and work to keep it streamlined and efficient.

I'm all for this. Lucas is out of the director's chair and working only as a creative consultant. That's where he needs to be. Otherwise, mostly all the same people that made the other films will be making these. Same special effects house, same concept guys, etc. As long as they get a good director and give any scripts a once over for clean-up, these could be the best Star Wars movies since the originals. Maybe I am overly optimistic, but that's how I see it.

I cannot say that obama is a muslim but I can tell you that he has never been a Christian. He belongs to the Black Liberation theology group which is actually based upon marxism and racism.  It was started by James H Cone (read his books) and basically they could not accept our Christian God as he loves ALL people and they (said) they could not worship a God who loved whites, so they made their own god and said he hated whites and loved blacks and so should they.. that makes them racists.  All those years the obamas went to that "church" that even has communist hierarchy in the leadership they never once complained about the racism.. they condoned it..  That makes them both racists.. I doubt that obama even knows what a Christian really is.

I use "Charity watch/ratings" to determine who I give to. I want to know that 70% or better of what I give gets to where it's intended and not chewed up in raising funds, admin. costs, etc. FEMA is taxpayer's money and we pay for it whether we want to or not. If you've ever actually been in a hurricane and suffered damages, you'd know that FEMA has a set of guidelines that it goes by and that's pretty much it. You either qualify or you don't? Even flood insurance has exclusions to it. It's just not a clear cut----yeah, it's a flood----pay me. Take a look at your homeowner's policy one time. I have a 2% wind damage deductible and I had to beg to get that. On a $200,000 home, the first $4,000 is mine, and I've paid it before. It was like 5%. I live in a high wind area and they know it. If you have a fixed value policy on your home, and it doesn't cover replacement costs, guess who pays???

To Nuad ormrac:  Yes, sadly people take advantage of natural disasters.  Halloween has never been a favorite holiday for me.  I can enjoy some of the costumes and candy for the children is fine. Those little hearts love the treats!  But, when people take advantage of a tornado, hurricane, wildfire, etc to rob helpless and already hurting people of what they have worked for, that is the lowest of low lifes in my opinion.  I just hope there will be adequate police protection to prevent thugs from getting close to the area.  The National Guard could serve a great purpose to stand at all entrances of the affected area and prevent anyone who doesn't live there from coming in.  Of course, the rescue personnel, firefighters, police, red cross, etc should not be hindered, but hte sightseers and thugs should be turned around at the entrances.

In Maryland I visited a formerly white church that had been sold to a black Baptist congregation.  The white congregation actually dug up their loved ones from the church yard where they were buried and moved them.  Left the excavated grave sites unfilled and as of 2009 that is how the courtyard of the church remained.

Does anybody remember that fable "The Ant and the Grasshopper"? Anyways, It would be more American for people to step up and help their neighbors without federal government help. I believe all states wouldn't stand back and watch a neighboring state suffer. There would be help on its way and it would be more faster and reliable than what the federal government can offer--and we all witnessed that catastrophe a few years ago with Katrina. But, it is more personal and more gratifying when people themselves along with volunteer groups help their fellow man in need. There is too much red tape and politics to rely on the federal government for aid.

cgn36,  your info is wrong.  The average annual equity mutual fund expense ratio is approximately 1.05% (you said "3-4%, how on earth did you come up with THAT?).    The front-end commissions on universal life average 70% or more.  Your "exposure" to the upside in an indexed life product is capped.   You can borrow some of the cash value of your life insurance contract, but when you do so in any significant way you diminish the death benefit. A death benefit should be the fundamental reason you bought life insurance in the first place.  If you take all of your money out- most of it even, you create a taxable event.  You see, the IRS allows you to borrow SOME of your cash value, but the tax code never intended a life insurance policy to be used as a primary investment vehicle.   \r\nLook, invest in that crap if you want to, but do not pitch it as a wonderful investment to others.  Commissions are not necessarily a bad thing, but commissions can become bad, evil even, when they are so fat that they become the reason sales people push life insurance as a primary investment.    One word can describe the motivation behind the pitch of life insurance as an "investment":  RATIONALIZE  ( pronounced:  RATIONAL LIES).   One does NOT invest in life insurance, one BUYS life insurance.  20-year term to protect a family until kids are through school.  Universall life for the truly affluent- those who will die with an estate valued above $4 million dollars, who wish to cover SOME of the estate tax with a tax-free death benefit (yes Virginia, you have to die to get the money).  As an investment, life insurance is a terribly, horribly wretched investment.

Well. women who opt not to have kids also get demonized from segments that say they aren't fulfilling their natural role.\r\n\r\nIt's a transition, and it's going to take another 50 years or so to get outmoded mindsets out of the way before women truly have the ability to choose what they want their lives to be without judgement.

So let me get this straight, GWB hailed from Texas, a state widely known for its kill and be killed policy for prisoners guilty of a capital crime. We kill more prisoners than 35 of the remaining states combined.  Huck says ... "the right to life from birth to natural death". How natural is it to die from lethal injection or electrocution in a chair mandated by the state to die.  \r\nThis is the same Huckabee that assisted Clemmons in killing four innocent people thanks to HUck letting him go free from prison.\r\nThe same Huck that said ... ."I almost wish that there would be a simultaneous telecast and all Americans would be forced, at gunpoint, to listen to every David Barton message," \r\nHe wants us held at gun point to be forced to listen to Bartons message.......gunpoi  ​ nt?\r\nSo he is okay with letting killers go free to commit more crime but not okay with a woman deciding not to have a rapist baby?  \r\nHe is okay with the death penalty though it does not induce natural death, but not okay with abortion. I guess its a matter of timing and not faith.

As per the other piece I wrote, this is why we don't say anything about the wonderful area we came across to take our kids to, because we figure the local parents and home owners would feel the local kids would end up losing out for all the droves or parents bringing in kids from elsewhere. It always leaves us feeling guilty, like we're keeping the place 'secret' for selfish reasons, but we just figure that going around telling one and all how great this area is would end up being counter-productive. Personally I'd love nothing better than to get on the rooftops and scream out that there's at least one place left in Orlando where people still know how to put on a memorable experience for kids on Halloween.

At this point, does it REALLY matter? We kids who grew up with the original three loved them. Lucas F'ed up with the second three and now is just looking to cash in on the exhausted franchise. Disney films, honestly, haven't been that great since they went for the boring digital look. \r\nI know the mommies and kiddies of today have no idea and will watch anything that you put a cute character in. They can use all the latest technology they want, put the new stuff will still pale in comparison. It's just not the same. Kids today are too distracted to really get the same joy out of it. The kind we had during those simpler days and greater films...IMO.

His daughter definitely has control of him. One daughter goes in the other daughter comes out....  \r\n   I can say this there are things that are unexplainable. My father didnt like me much but would do anything for my brother. I never understood it but I didnt let it ruin my life although as a result it has caused me alot of trouble dealing with my brother because he  clearly doesnt know what give me a hand means when you ask for help. He is too good for that lol. I wont embelish further but lets just say his claim is he has grown past that kind of work and doesnt do it anymore..... I am five years the elder and I still work at labor. I have not grown past anything.  \r\n   Parents need to really work much harder to avoid creating such anomallies because they are a gift/curse that keeps on giving long after they have passed away. end rant

Appearing on the networks this morning, Christie, for the third day in a row, heaped praise on Obama’s handling of the storm. “The President has been outstanding in this,” he told the “Today” show. On “Morning Joe,” he said, “It’s been very good working with the President. He and his Administration have been coördinating with us. It’s been wonderful.” Speaking on CNN, Christie said that he had been mightily impressed by Obama’s accessibility throughout the crisis. “He gave me his number at the White House, told me to call him if I needed anything, and he absolutely means it.” Christie also pointed out that Obama didn’t once bring up politics in their conversations, and added, “If he’s not bringing it up, you can be sure that people in New Jersey are not worried about that, primarily if one of the guys running isn’t."

CALLING ON ALL AMERICANS FOR SUPPORT... of the Great American Reconciliation. Who has our money? Why and how did they get it? What role do law firms, alumni relationships, networks and groups have to do with it? It's no secret that we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in 2014. I can't imagine a more appropriate time to have our currency and all those who touch it... fully reconciled and working full power in our favor. It seems to me that there are an awful lot of administrators in high places not necessarily in our government, that have as much or more power and influence as our government. That's not a good Civil Right because We the People don't vote them in or out and there is no regulatory and supervisory oversight. I'm a father who wants to see America give his kids a fair and equal chance without two classes or an upper and lower distinction of the masses. I don't want to wait until 2014 to suddenly draw focus to Civil Rights. That Act passed FIFTY years ago. It shouldn't be illuminated for celebration, it should be celebrated as the normal everyday. \r\n\r\nI need your help. I support Civil Rights, not a New World Order. How about you?

A true democracy is always an issue.  Rights can be trampled way to easy.  I like the concept however.  The issue of taxes being raised is always an issue. \r\n To deal with that our founders insisted on EQUAL taxation.  That lasted until about 100 years ago, when people refused to pay for things.  They, however, were perfectly OK with these things as long as someone else was paying for them.   \r\n These issues can only be resolved if ALL taxes are EQUAL.   Then direct democracy works.  Until then it will fail, with some being more equal than others, and have their load carried by someone else. \r\n As soon as people will have to PAY for what they want, the want list will go down dramatically.  Only truly WORTHY expenses would ever pass muster.

The 'natural causes' means he was no 'foul play' in his death. He died on his own by his own idiocy. The bar owner was also an idiot. Now..instead of a couple of days closed down for investigations he just may be closed for at least 15 months (unless he has a great manager who is willing to keep the bar open until the owner is released from prison).  I do wonder, though, if the dead man drank all that booze to die of alcohol poisoning in THAT bar or did he go bar-hopping????

I wonder when people talk about religion if they really are talking from a position of educated intelligence or just using religion to spread their ridiculous agenda. If you have read the Book of Mormon, the Bible and the Koran and spent time discussing each with other scholars then I deem you an expert on the subject. Otherwise, shut your mouth and just listen to experts. And also if your voting on just one issue to limit everyone else rights, don't vote. We don't need narrow, uneducated voters.

So I guess Huck is in favor of changing the government from a democratic republic to a democratic theocracy. The next logical step will be appointing a "Christian" mullah to oversee the enforcement of all the new fundamentalist laws that will soon be spewing forth. I guess Huck is hoping that his unfailing devotion to his fundamentalist christian principles will get noticed and his name will be on the short list for the new position that will obviously include the coveted "hotline" to god.

It's funny something like this is brought up.  It seems no one wants to report on, or talk about, our failed economy, our terrible unemployment and underemployment, our horrible foreign policy, four murdered Americans in Libya, our horrible energy policy, our huge skyrocketing debt, medical insurance costs going through the roof, no budget out of Washington in four years, a medical plan no one voted for, GM fail, $4 gas,.....need I go on.

Hey Not so Sensible....here's a thought did me  telling Donnie to shut the hell up or shove something up his A$$ offend you little girl?  Too f*cking bad!!  Clearly you aren't too sensible as your name states as if you were you'd have enough God given sense not to come onto my post spewing your judgments my way.  Seeing how you wish to bring up my parents, allow me to return the favor bitch, perhaps (NO E MORON) the best part of you was left behind on your parent's sheets....or more than likely in the back alley dumpster where your momma was working at the time.....and what is evident from your posting aside from the fact that you are an illiterate judgmental prude, not to mention a coward,  is that your mother should have aborted you while she still had the chance.....thanks for stopping by A$$hole!!!

The media never tells the the people that Millions have been spent sealing Barry Sorato's records that would show he went to Oxidental College as a foreigen student from Kenya.. Not Hawaii. it would show his Markists leanings in his writings and who he associates with during his youth... The Donald Has aleast raised the issues that most didn't pay attention to ... if Obama is suppost to be the most transparent president ..then what is your excuse for letting this ride.. where is your sense that something is sooo wrong with this man.. and while your fact checking look at Soros  , who is a capitalist whore who is backing this Lier, this Godfather without a brain.. OBAMA DIDN'T WANT THIS JOB.. BUT IT IS PAYING HIM WELL TO BE THE FACE OF SOROS, MUSLIMS, AND EVERYTHING THAT IS WRONG WITH THIS COUNTRY... GOOD FOR THE DONALD.. America has always celebrated Success.. now that is a dirty word... Where is the America of just 10 years ago...

What I find funny is Mitt hasn't "flip-flop (ed)" on any issues... but when obama was running for office, his political platform was for whomever he was talking to... was against gay rights... then wasn't... was against abortion... then wasn't... was for imediate withdrawl from Iraq... then was for a gradual withdrawl... \r\n  \r\nHe's the BEST flip-flopper...
1
Of course he won't answer because he'd have to tell the truth. Everyone has seen his remarks from the primaries so how can he say anything different.  Notice how his campaign put out the lies about the auto industry in Ohio when they knew Obama wouldn't respond.  Cowards.  Anyone with half a brain has to question everything Romney says.  He has been called out by fact checkers so many times and yet he blatantly puts out more lies, doesn't anyone see a problem with this guy's character?

I just can't believe how many people are (upset) over a flu shot, yes you can still get the flu, it only has so many variations in it. Does your (upset) also apply to tetanus shots, where you could die from lockjaw? or polio shots, my uncle had polio, not a bad case but left with a limp and some wound up in iron lungs, no more thanks to polio vaccine. And for some who say they got shot and got the flu, it takes a couple of weeks for shot to work up in system, so you could've came in contact with flu virus a couple of days before you got the shot. You (cannot) get the flu from a flu shot and yes the stores etc who give do like to make money, it's called business.

And what about John, the disciple that Jesus loved the most.  Seriously, that passage is verrrrrrrry interesting.  I can't remember what gospel it's in but there's a scene where Jesus is hanging with the harem and someone walks into the room and asks for him.  The next line says something like--"And John, the apostle that Jesus loved the most, lifted his head from Jesus' chest".   Hmmmmmmmmmmmm.

I see where you say "Obama seems like he cares". I guess he also seems like he knows something about economics. He seems like he knows about healthcare. He seems like he knows about job creation. He seems like he cares about Hispanics. He seems like he cares about Latinos. It seems like he thinks he can cure everything by spend, spend, spend. But, it you have to borrow, borrow, borrow, you're going to pay, pay, pay, later on. Or maybe you're kids will be able to cough up the cash to his Arab sheik.

Laurel does not care that Obama is a complete failure, and neither do many others. You can see by her above comment that she believes we 'conservatives' (lol) are "uneducated, brain-dead, slackjawed yokels"....obviously  ​  she has it all figured out and is the perfect poster child for the liberals...offering nothing of substance to substantiate her blind faith. \r\n \r\nThe big difference Laurel, between me (a conservative) and you is that I never bought in to the bullsh*t, brainwashing rhetoric that is like a disease in our education system, from kindergarten to grad school, and I went allllll the way through. I do now, always have, and always will base my opinions on my life experiences, and never take the word of another. \r\n \r\nI have no idea how old you are, I myself, am in my mid thirties and have had many experiences that shape my beliefs, but you seem to me to be very young, insulting, and quite frankly still under the influence of others, strongly. \r\n \r\nI'll wish you the best of luck, growing up is hard to do.

I agree with the list,except for Two,and a Half Men. They have had a few shows that still were funny. Ashton's part needs a lot more work to make him funny.His type of humor doesn't fit the show.

I'd like to see better work by the writers of that show.The rest of the shows listed don't  have any entertsinment value.

Ban abortion, Ban contraceptives. Have biblical fairy tale Creationism taught in all schools as a true science, force women to have vaginal ultrasounds. \r\nThe true goals of the radical cracked teanuts and their bosses Groper Nutquist and slapped **** lyin Willardo, ther Mexican Mormon Moron tax evading draft doger. \r\nCan you imagine what might have happened if the Pope's boy Rick the Dick Sanitarium became V.P. under lyin Willardo, the tax evader, of the right wing radical cracked teanuts, the gay, rapist, pedophile catholic priests and the braindead evangelical nuts that listen to them. Men will no longer have to purchase condoms, as they will no longer be allowed in this country. All mens sperm must be used to create babies. Cameras will be in every bedroom. Catholic priests don't have to worry however, because, according to the testimony of former raped little boys, they don't use them. \r\nThe Pope's first order to his boy would be to release all catholic rapist pediophile priests from prison as the Pope is running out of people to continue the process of shearing his sheep. He is running out of collection pot fillers. After all, he needs the money to fight off all of the lawsuits against the church worldwide. \r\nHis second order to RickyDickyDo would be to move the White House to Vatican City.

Repuke dopes that listen to lyin Willardo, the Mexican Mormon Moron tax evader, bankrupter, draft dodger, job outsourcer and Etch A Sketch Champion are some of the dumbest idiots on earth.\r\nEverything lyin Willardo feeds his braindead followers is a myth. I am sure he would be doing better if he told these repuke dopes that he would create 50 million jobs in the next 4 years. They don't need to be told how.\r\n \r\nClueless Lyin Willardo should not even be running for president. But for a lyin moron, talk is cheap. This clueless moron has no idea how to fix anything. This criminal repuke bankupts companies and loses jobs. What a joke. The nuts that follow him actually believe that he is going to create 12 million new jobs and these dopes believe him. He does not have to tell them how, that does not matter.\r\n \r\nClueless Lyin Willardo is known as the slapped axx Mexican Mormon Moron for good reason. This complete dunce made himself look even more ignorant than he already is by stating in a campaign clip that if he ever overpaid his taxes, he does not deserve to be your president. Well this repuke dunce overpaid his 2011 taxes by $3,000 to make it look like he was paying a higher tax rate-which he can recover after the election. He has up to 3 years to refile an amended return. Only a pathetic, psychotic, braindead radical right wing cracked teanut dope will vote for him.

From the headline, I was thinking that he'd just postponed it for himself, and I thought, "That's great!

NYC is a bloody mess.  \r\n  \r\n As to AR and WE, saw them live in August at a festival in Hasting-On-Hudson, NY, which they graceously agreed to do despite a wheather cancellation the day before.  I know there was talk here on EW a while ago about unballanced live stage dynamics between them, but the music sounded great that day.  Yes, WE did seem a tad "self-involved" and snotty re AR and her music (a back catalogue that is a lot more impressive than his), but I took it that was just his idea of amusing stage business. And, listening to her albums, well, I mean, come on, she is a great singer-songwriter and artist, one of the best we have, but if any of that stuff int he songs is based on real life, what kind of guys to you think she goes for? Mature and sensitive and thoughtful?

CEO BOB IGER, in his last quarterly address for Walt Disney Corporation, said there would be no more purchases. Why did you lie Bob? You said shareholders could look forward in 2013 to rising profits because all deals were paid for like Disney's expansion of Anaheim park, the new cruise ships and the Hawaiian Resort and profits were rolling in. Then you go and make an offer for LucasFilm that requires $2 billion cash and over $2 billion in new stock to be issued, dilluting our shares further. LucasFilm only generates $200 million/year. That's 10 years to break even on the cash offer. What if the next Star Wars movie flops? When is enough enough? When will you allow shareholders to finally make some real money? This deal requires such a long long term view that I see no reason for the stock to go up tomorrow, only to go down. Disney is a $40 stock at best as long as the leadership keeps dilluting the shares with more purchases. It's not fair to make us wait 10 years or more for a decent return. Boo to Bob Iger.

I agree with most of the shows should be canceled I have to admit I have not seen them all I think we need to go back to three stations right now anything will get on the air. The part that gets me is most of the mixed couple show have a black man with a blond and and celeberity dance show it is the same type of thing I'm  sorry It seem to be to be playing the race card for rating.

AQUA MAN: \r\nDo you know where Benghazi is? It's half a world away and it takes 20 hours to get there. Please tell me how the president was supposed to stop an attack that was underway from half a world away? Congress (can we say Republicans?) cut funding and reduced the funds needed to provide additional security that was requested by our overseas officials. There are hundreds of American Ambassadors across the world. The government in those countries are supposed to provide security for our people when they are assigned there, like we provide security when their Ambassadors are in the US. Most of those countries resist the USA posting our US Marines in their country. We do have Marines at our foreign Embassies, though. There are soooooooooo many things that you are either unaware of or choose to be ignorant of. Research would be a good place to start.

What's wrong with it? The guy sounds like a stranger to America, not to mention S. Dakota, living in all other places but here, and then magically appears to run for a seat? I think the point was made that Kristi is from there and knows the people and what is good for them. Very clever I thought.

One of the best shows out there, in my opinion, is the legal series, "Good Wife". This is one of the best shows I have ever encountered, and has now pushed "Criminal Minds" from 1st place to 2nd place in the  position of my personal favorites.\r\n \r\nThis is a suspenseful, mind wracking  show that should continue on indefinitely. I recommend that those with an adult mind and way of thinking view at least one show....careful, you might get hooked!!!.

Apprently Two and A Half Men are receiving a lot of viewers. Are they mostly made up of high school and/or college-aged boys??? I haven't seen a full episode; but when the series started way back with Charlie Sheen, the segments and previews I did see seem way too 'risque' for primetime. All segments seem to be about what hottie Charlie is going to bed, and then showing him in bed with the girls-sometimes more than one. And one of the main characters was a pre-teen male????? Yep--a real role model Charlie is/was--NOT! I haven't seen anything with Ashton's character but I bet the storylines are NOT that far from the earlier shows. Am I right????  \r\nThis show is not going to get cancelled until the viewership drops dramatically or the actors in the show call it a day.

two things never to discuss in mixed company: politics and religion. I really want to vote for Romney this term mainly due to the lack of fulfillment by Pres Obama. However I vote according to character not promises or party. Knowing that Romney is a former leader in the Mormon church (resigned leadership to focus on politics) and is still a devout member of this belief system is a bit disturbing. True fact: Beliefs govern what you think, say, and do. So what about the "special underpants" that he wears to shield from demons? What about his god living on another planet and waiting to destroy Earth only to repopulate it with Mormon believers? Black people are a cursed decendent of Cain? That's not even the wierd stuff- go read up on Mormonism and see what you think! So who do I vote for- the Donkey, the Elephant, or the Cocoa Puffs bird?

Judging the person and the actions of a person are two different things.  Jesus is the only judge that matters.  It is not for us to judge a person but that does not mean we should not speak out when their actions go against God.  One of the commandments is "Thou shall not kill."  God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah because of homosexual acts.  It is not force to tell someone these actions are wrong because they are against God and that you do not support these actions.  The sins we have committed are between God and the individual, but does that mean you would not instruct a child on what is right and wrong.  We are all children of God.

Huckabee is 100% right !!...  so all of you christians, when you go to vote...remember which canidate is a member of one of the Largest orgainzed Cults in the world.  Remember Which canidates religion takes the christan bible (gods word)and makes it secondary to the make belive book known as the mormon bible "another testament of jesus christ".  Remeber that the bible says  \r\n  \r\nEveryone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting, for whoever greets him takes part in his wicked works \r\n  \r\n  \r\nnow if you want to leave religion out of the conversation...then you should vote for the canidate that you think will do best for the country.  after all we do have seperation of church and state. \r\n  \r\nso what i am saying is....   dont be a hypocrite.   if you want to vote for Mitt or obama for no other reason then one is republican or one is democrat  then do it!!! i can accept the fact that you choose to be an uniformed voter and mindlessly cast your vote for whom ever.   what i cant stand is that christians conservatives that are willing to push god aside, gods word aside for their political party. Then turn around and justify it by saying it is what god wants.     \r\n  \r\nthis is why we have seperation of church and state.  we have a mix of races, religions in this country.  goverment needs to make sure our roads are fixed, our economy improves,people have safe, food,goods,health care.   it is our individual responsiblity to instill our morals, beliefs to our children.         Again.....if you are a christian and want to vote for Mitt Rommney..that is fine.  just do not say it is what God would want.    it is what you want.       Hypocracy is the path leading to hell.  A true testament to people is how you lead your life.  every time a televangilist gets caught in a lie...or a sex scandal.....when high profile christians disregard the bibles teachings it sends a message to all non belivers that  chrisitianity is farce.

If Flopney is elected President (God Help Us All), he will seek to privatize everything he can get his hands on so they can evade laws, charge high prices for their goods and services.  He will continue what he did at Bain by allowing companies to outsource jobs to China.  Romney will sell out America. He is not a visionary, not a deep thinker, very superficial.  McCain should be ashamed of himself for knocking Obama while he deals with the disaster that affected the eastern sea board.  \r\nAs for Romney, he will continue to lie, distort the truth to his advantage because that's what he does best.  He was a lousy Governor and will be even worse as the President.  He is not fit to govern this nation.  We need to keep him and his neanderthal GOP party away from Washington.

Could you please stop contradicting yourself? Youre sorry, then youre not sorry. You are going to post differently in the future but stand by the ignorant posts at the same time. Which is it?! LOL. Are you sorry you offended people, or are you standing by your (edited) comments.? No. YOU and ignorant people like you need to 'GO AWAY.'

Life insurance is a horrible investment.  The fees loaded on by the insurance company cripple growth.  And the "tax free" withdrawals are a loan from the cash value that diminish the death benefit.  Commissions on these dogs are fat, so insurance people love to push them.  There are only two reasons to buy life insurance and savings is not one of them. It should telling too, that we do not hear about wealthy people parking their money in life insurance policies (and I mean the truly affluent). Why do you think that is?  We hear a lot about Warren Buffett's investment in stocks, but not in insurance policies.  Interestingly, Mr. Buffett does- through his company- invest directly into insurance companies though.  Insurance is a profitable business, especially life insurance.  Life insurance policies are TERRIBLE investments.  HORRIBLE (!!!)

AS FOR YOU Ms. moxie, your rather expanded vocabulary had me thinking you were smarter than the average msn commenter but I see now that your just another partisan puppet, voraciously defending your party even if it means defending all those right wing whack jobs out there and attacking a president who, let's be honest here, could be doing a MUCH worse job.

Valid comments every time there is a handout from the government there is fraud that shows up. \r\n If the handout or aid as it is called is for housing then it should be paid directly to the landlord or hotel or whom ever is providing the space. if it is for food it should be in the form that is usable only for food. \r\n it is not that difficult to set up with what is already in place. that will not stop all fraud but it will slow it down. \r\n I know I administer funds to help people with rent and food and I do not get tricked when I follow the correct procedures.

Seems like the people affected most by Sandy could use the $5,000,000 that Obama could give them. \r\nAll he has to do is show his college transcripts. Seems like easy money for a great cause. Why is Obama witholding 5 million from them? Probably for the same reason he is witholding an explanation about watching the attack on the US Embassy in real time and not sending help when it was requested twice. Witnesses have him bouncing a tennis ball off the wall while watching.

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, dump all of the so called "reality shows". I mean come on people, use your heads. How real can something be when a camera is following you around!!!!!  I don't care what silly situations the Jonas brothers or Ice and Coco or Honey boo-boo or any of those other people get into. \r\nWhat has happened to the creative people we had in years past. All the TV execs can do now is copy another show that has become popular. There are very few original shows on TV anymore and when something fresh comes on it is gone before the audience even has a chance to get in to it.

Well...I'm not so sure this is a bad thing.\r\n \r\nThe best Original Star Wars movie was Empire Strikes Back and that was will Lucas's stupid hands off as Director. If anything I would like for him NOT to be involved at all - he got rid of it? Cool - now let someone with some real talent take it over instead of making a kiddie-centric film every time. \r\n \r\nHonestly besides Star Wars a New Hope - every Star Wars movie he made had some suckiness to it (although Jedi was still much better than the - SHUDDER - prequesls). \r\n \r\nI think it's also important to think about time as Han Solo and Luke ain't getting any younger in real life.\r\n \r\nAs someone else pointed out - there is some GOOD content out there for the Star Wars universe - they just need to tap into it  - and keep Lucas away from it.

No but you have to respect them, they are an animal that changes their minds quickly! I hunt them for meat & for profit. I have mixed pits & mastiffs as catch dogs & cur & walker mix as hit dogs, & some times the big hogs are to much for them! A hog can do enough damage to a person that, if there is no help it could be fatal, thats if it wants to stay & fight you. I had 125 lbs. dogs gutted, nuts cut off,& throats cut out, they are very powerful beast. Their not scared of anything, if a mama has some little strip ones best thing to do is leave it alone she'll fight anything at the drop of a hat! Best thing to do call a professional or a hunter that knows what to do,& bring your kids, pets indoors!

While I can't  speak for everyone in these pictures my sister has really gotten into this body building thing  in the last 2 years and she does not take steroids.  She went from 295 pounds and she is now down to 167 she needs to lose about 15 more in order to get to the point to compete this up coming spring.   Her trainer does not even believe in tanning beds because of the toxicity of them. It is a lot of contnued hard work and needs to be kept up to maintain this muscle mass and it is not for everyone. I do however agree that some of the people pictured look like they poured carmel sauce all over them and it does not look natural.

The movie could work, but note I said COULD.  On the flip side, Disney is a massive cash cow, that to give some idea of the size even owns the movie studios that created the Freddie Crouger movies (AKA Nightmare on Elm Street)...  We're talking like 1 of 5 media mega corps here, of the size of Vivendi-Universal and AOL-Time Warner (though the AOL was dropped from the name sometime after the merger). \r\n  \r\nActually that's not what concerns me so much though.  There was originally an episode 7, 8, and 9 in the original concept idea.  It's the new movie every 2 years after, suggesting this might be turned into a franchise which could go well beyond the original 9?  I don't know, Hollywood seems to have been doing a lot of this as of late.  It's like when they had the previews for Total Recall, I was sitting there thinking "saw that", along with a "that hard up on cash now?  Can't think of new movie ideas to get us to buy the movie tickets anymore?" :o  Another trilogy, if they do a decent job at it, and here is an if, could be a good thing.  But turning it into a never ending franchise, could kill it, if they just keep drawing it out for every last dime they could get from the thing.... \r\n  \r\nStories do tend to have an inevitable end; something another Sci-Fi director and author (JMS, who released Babylon 5) made quite clear when he let the television industry know that one the B5 story line was over, but as to spin offs, he won't let them mess it up for a quick buck.  He walked during first season of Crusade and pulled the story...

Although many of us would love to claim that what we believe does not form a basis for how we are, I cannot separate who I am from what I do and say \r\n... I base my opinions on the teachings of Jesus Christ. Other than His, my opinion counts for little. But I do know that there is mercy because we are still here; justice because we have reaped what we have sown; love because I can see those who don't believe as I do through the loving eyes of a loving Savior.

I think you all are missing the point !\r\nSomething tells me that TRUMP already knows about Obamas records. That man has more money than GOD and I betcha he's ready to drop a huge pile. So here we are again... If Obama has nothing to hide, then why not release the records. What's the harm ? He should be bending over backwards to offer the people of the United States what they need.\r\n \r\nI think he was born in Kenya and lied about a whole bunch of things. How he ever passed through the requirements to run for the Presidency is again another question. Somebody is behind all this and I just wish he'd just provide what has been asked of him. It's not that hard to do if he is, in fact, legit. Which he obviously is not.

It's no coincidence that the best of the existing six movies is "Empire"...the one that Lucas didn't direct!!

You might have a point if Oblabla was indeed a Christian. But, sadly he just calls himself a Christian because it's politically expedient. He is a Muslim. Muslims believe that it's okay to lie to "infidels." So, I guess this is his justification for his continuous stream of lies, i.e.\r\n-If you like your health insurance, you can keep it.\r\n-It was the video that caused the death of four courageous Americans in Benghazi\r\n-The Catholic institutions who object to paying for contraceptive and abortion pills don't have to. (No, it's just their insurance companies who are required to provide them, but who pays for the insurance?)\r\n\r\nThe list goes on and on...\r\n\r\nNo, this man is not a Christian, indeed he is the anti-Christ!

Hey MG....You still out there....Here is the response to your "taxes drive the rich out" BS argument.  From Yahoo News >>>\r\n\r\n \r\n- As Californians debate the "rich tax" contained in Gov. Jerry Brown's , a new report challenges one argument for lowering tax rates on the wealthy: that millionaires simply move to avoid higher taxes, leaving the middle class with a higher burden.  \r\n\r\n\r\n…The study, by sociologists at Stanford and Princeton, looked at two tax changes in California, a 1996 tax cut on high-income filers and a 2005 levy called the Mental Health Services Tax that took one percent of income over $1 million. Using tax-return data, the researchers examined how the changes affected "millionaire migration" in or out of the state before and after the tax laws were passed.  \r\nThe research showed that millionaires not only were unmoved, so to speak, by their taxes being raised, "the highest-income Californians were less likely to leave the state after the millionaire tax was passed," wrote Charles Varner...\r\n\r\nIn fact, the richer the Californian, the more likely he or she was to stay, the study found. Nor did the data suggest that lowering taxes lured millionaires to the state"\r\n\r\nProsecution rests....

Many of the 'voices' on here are paid-for and they have seemingly vanished into the background.  Votes are still being pumped, as V_L indicates.  \r\n\r\nHowever, I have reason to feel that Classique is a true patriot, and her willingness to discuss various topics from politics and small business to barbecue sauce with the likes of me is proof enough of her 'real' stature on the board.  She wants what is best for the country, as do many of the other 'real people' here.  Question is, how to go about it?  She feels switching horses in the middle of the race is a solution; I dont.  But however she opines, she certainly has earned the right to do so and thus, I must express support for her First Amendment rights, just as surely as I would have "deklens" or "taxpayer1".   But thats just me.\r\n\r\nI also love the 'action' so....Carry on, dear colleagues.

To Boe Dillard;  Thanks for your response!  It was actually funny to some degree.  Yes, I do think the lady should have been allowed more time, but not an hour!! Maybe she could have been warned at three minutes to end her statements within two more mintues and then just shut the microphone off.  And, escort her out if she got unruly.  But, citizens vote for their council and the council should listen to them.  I got irrritated during the first presidential debate when Romney wouldn't shut up and the moderator let him keep interrupting Obama and pressing into Obama's time.  For a national presidential debate aired by a major news organization, I thought little prefessional planning wien into that debate.  In my opinion, there should have been a switch whereby the moderator could have said "your time is up in 30 seconds" and after 30 seconds, he could hit the swtich and send the microphone into silence.  Or, just program the mic to stay on for two minutes and then go silent.  I think that would take care of the rudeness I saw from especially Romney.  I'm not favoring Obama and since he is an incumbent, I won't vote for him.  However, I"m not sure I'll vote for Romney either.  I really don't think we have a good choice this year.  I have considered voting for an independent or just write in my dog's name.  Not smart but I don't think I have a good choice.  But, I would have not had the police handcuff the lady at that point.  maybe after a warning, then handcuff her if she didn't end her dialogue.  I think it would have been just as justified to handcuff Romney but he wasn't handcuffed and escorted out.  He is no better than the lady who was.

I wish the people of America would stop and realize what is going on. We have become a selfish country with selfish leaders. Obama is not a Christian. He does not know what he is. You are not a Christian by saying you are one. There has to be evidence and there is none. Yes Romney is a Morman, but they maintain the ultimate values that America was founded on. If you go back and look at all the "great" nations of the past and how they fell, we are lining up right along side of them. They became selfish and immoral. All I ask is that you read a little history and see that America will not stand much longer if we do not get back to the Christian values that we were founded on. I know some of you do not believe this, so answer this question for me...Why is Christianity the only "religion" that can not be publicly practiced in any form in schools or government with out making the headlines negatively? In education we can not deny a Muslim there right to pray (publicly) to their god three time a day but we have to ask our students not to pray to Christ out loud. So like we are persecuting Christians, who were the ones who founded the United States of America. If you do not believe me read the documented history of the founding fathers. If you do not believe me and do not do your research to find the truth, as Jesus said hanging on the cross; "Lord forgive them for the know not what they do".(Luke 23:34)

Water does not need to rise anymore to see what surges can do to NYC now.  We need to start talking seriously about barriers to protect NYC.  It will take at least 10 years to get this done, if not longer.  9/11, recent regional blackouts, Sandy, etc. have all shown us that this is a problem for the whole country not just NY.

Even Ron Paul dumps the repuke dunce party.  He calls them "liars, cheaters and criminlas".\r\nThis is great news. Gary Johnson may take away some of the Mexican Mormon Moron's votes.\r\n \r\nThis is great news for Obama. Ron Paul has "washed his hands" of the republican party after 30 years. He claims they are liars, cheats and criminals. His backers will probably not vote for lyin Willardo, the Mexican Mormon Moron tax evader, bankrupter, draft dodger, job outsourcer and Etch a Sketch Champion. This should easily allow Obama to win. His backers are considering drafting Gary Johnson, the former governor of New Mexico to run.\r\n \r\nJohnson, in my opinion, is too honest to win. He is truly, the only decent candidate the repuke freaks had, but they shut him out. Repukes - the party of voter supression.\r\n \r\n"The irony of the announcement by Congressman Paul is that it was the Republican party who first rejected him, long before Paul's decision to wash his hands of the GOP. During the primary campaign season, multiple Republican committees in states across the country used rule changes and local law enforcement to ensure the Texas Congressman did not succeed in winning primaries. Couple this with the fraudulent attempt to keep Ron Paul from being nominated at the Convention by stealing his delegates in Maine, and in other states, and it is no surprise that the soon to retire Congressman has had enough of the corrupt political party he supported for more than 30 years."

Trump may seem like a nutter, but I keep asking myself, "Why is the President's documentation still an issue?"  And the answer always boils down to "because he keeps deflecting from the issue of his documentation and has never produced it."  His so-called birth certificate had so many holes in it, you could have played golf on it.  Obama keeps saying he's not going to play these silly little games concerning his docs, but anyone else would not have even been able to run for any office without absolute and solid proof that he was a citizen.  The only silly little game being played here is "how much longer can he get away with it?"

Wow, apparently someone got themselves a job working where their opinion can be crappy and they still get paid.  While I can agree on some of these, Two and a half Men is still brilliant and the change they made with Ashton should be applauded.  How I Met Your Mother is the best show on TV, it is a modern day Friends only actually leaving you in a cliffhanger every week.  It is probably the best written show on TV and, while I do want to know who the mother is, I don't want to just yet!  And seriously, how can you say Whitney is as bad as you say while you have shows out there that never should have made it past pre-production.  I will say this, get rid of American Idol, Glee and that terrible Grey's Anatomy first, then kill off the others you mentioned, but the 3 I laid out, you need to wake up and remember what good TV is all about.

If you do not belived that there is a God and creator of the universe and all that is in it, don't bother to read this comment any further as it will mean nothing to you.  If you do believe in the God of the Bible then be aware of this:\r\n \r\nThe True God has no interst whatsoever in the world's political systems including the one in the United States of America.  The entire world's political systems belong to Satan the Devil.  When Jesus was tempted in the desert after his baptism, Satan offered him "all the kindgdoms of the world" for an act of worship.  How could he offer these if he did not hold title to them?  Note that Jesus did not deny that Satan could give them to him as Jesus knew that they were Satan's to give.  Further along, Jesus himself stated that Satan was the "ruler of the world" and that that one had no hold on him (Jesus).\r\n \r\nBoth the Book of Daniel and the Book of Revelation (Apocalypse) state that this Satanic rulership of the world will come to and end and will be replaced by a government that will "stand for all time".  This government is very close at hand so vote for whomever you wish as in the near future it will make no difference.

I still can't get over the fact that for some people, politics trumps everything. We have  a natural disaster and instead of caring about the people effected by it, there are people talking politics. Seriously, F all of you. I'm one of the people being effected by this storm and have seen the damage it caused first hand and you're going to talk politics. How about putting politics to the side and lending a hand? Or might that be too much actual work for you keyboard cowboys?

He is one of 11, who opposed the bill  to give aid to Katrina victims in the first place.\r\nHe would rather not have any help given than to see some of it probably not being used as it should.  I'd say that's heartless.

This guy is a tool no doubt and shouldn't even have let it get that far, and seriously you can't tell whether a baby is gonna be cute or not until they're about 9 months old when there features take on some definition. But on one hand I can almost understand why he did it. Humans mate based on certain physiological aspects that most of the time they aren't even aware of, facial symmetry, wider hips on women versus narrow (thus ensuring safe delivery), eye shape (larger versus smaller) etc. Then couple that with China's one child law, and he was in fact defrauded and pissed off that what he signed up for was definitely not what he got. So he wants a divorce so he can remarry and probably have another kid, and since he already has one, he has to pay the government a fee of around 120K for the right to do so, the exact amount he was awarded by the judge, also if he wins the case the kid gets classified as physically unacceptable, couple that with her being a girl and his chances of being approved to have a second child just tripled. So yeah, he's actually even more of a douche because the lawsuit was obviously very calculated.

It has the potential to be good, Disney has the resources to make it outstanding, but the most important thing that Disney must do is to keep the "same feel" of the other movies.  Especially the original first 3 movies.  Keep it simple, but interesting.  Use the same recipe for the new ones as the old original 3.  Maybe have references to the other movies that parallel the new ones, but with new characters.  Maybe like an adventure of a new Jedi Knight after the fall of the Empire or it could be another adventure of a Jedi Knight during the Empires rule somewhere else in the galaxy.  The storyline could go many different directions, but the most important thing is that they don't make a movie that was like Episode I.

Keep your focus on the real Messiah Christ of the Heavens, secure yourself. Justice 'will' be done. Alternative media teaching Christian atonement is powerful stuff. The worldly medias hate these sites and tend to hide truth from the people most the time. Take heed, and worry about you and your eternal security first, less you lose too - like those four Americans in Benghazi. Faith (trust), hope, and no a non-grudging thankful love for all. You are called to service. Your life is already written in the eternal Book of Life, unless you and your free-will blots it out forever. Take heed, justice will be done.

Great point, Augure!  So many people just ASSume if someone is against a certain faith, they must not know anything about it.  Or, if they are an atheist now, they don't have a history with church, religion or faith.  But, nothing could be further from the truth.  Often the most vocal opponents have their reasons for being so vocal... and those reasons are often rooted in their past.\r\n \r\nOne doesn't even have to be of faith to understand that the LDS faith is blasphemous toward mainstream Christianity.  Also, there are plenty of former Mormons who understand this, as well... even among those who haven't adopted a new faith since leaving 'The Church'.

In the past, Our Great Nation was blessed by GOD because we were founded on and maintained Biblical morals and values. This is no longer the case as this nation now promotes and allows the killing of innocent babies (as did Pharaoh of Egypt and King Herod who was attempting to kill The Christ Child) and embraces homosexuality (the very reason GOD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah). These two acts of mankind (abortion and homosexuality) are among the most DETESTABLE ABOMINATIONS AGAINST GOD! Anyone who believes that GOD will bless this nation while we allow these ABOMINATIONS AGAINST GOD to continue is simply ignorant of THE TRUE WORD OF GOD (The Bible).  \r\n“Christian” means = “CHRIST like”. JESUS CHRIST IS THE TRUE WORD OF GOD (The Bible)….. \r\nJOHN 1:14 “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.” \r\nPROVERBS 29:26 Many seek the ruler’s (political leaders) favour; But every man’s judgment cometh from the LORD. \r\nDEUTRONOMY 28:45 Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep His commandments and His statutes which He commanded thee: JAMES 4:4 Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world (politically correct) is the enemy of God. II JOHN verse 9 Whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. II JOHN verse 10 If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine (THE TRUE WORD OF GOD,The Bible), receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed: II JOHN verse 11 For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds. \r\nDid you hear THE TRUE WORD OF GOD? A True Christian will not even wish “God speed” to a politician who is in favor of abortion and homosexuality rights, let alone vote for that politician! Any self proclaimed Christian or anyone else who desires to be “a friend of the world” (politically correct) when it comes to abortion and homosexuality rights “is an enemy of GOD” and is not being Christ like (Christian) at all!  Anyone who votes for or supports in any way a politician who is against or opposes THE WORD OF GOD “in even one point” (this includes abortion and homosexuality), is a “partaker of ALL of his evil deeds” and in THE EYES OF GOD is “guilty” of performing every abortion and every homosexual act! \r\nJAMES 2:10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. \r\nAccording to THE TRUE WORD OF GOD WHO IS JESUS CHRIST: Mike Huckabee is RIGHT!

Mitt Rubbish was wrong on FEMA, wrong on Ben Laden, wrong on the automobile industry, wrong on female (Family) issues, wrong on the Middle East so much so in his last debate that he champion everything the president was saying, wrong on China, Now these are just some of the things he was wrong on NOW! What about how he just blatantly lies: you can go to YouTube and find so many videos where he says one thing and when you ask him the same question a week later he says something different. HOW COULD THIS PERSON BE A BETTER CHOICE?... GO FIGURE Also don't forget he wants to give tax break to the top 1% and he bashes  47% of Americans behind close door AND TO THOSE WHO THINK THIS IS A GOOD CHOICE FOR AMERICA  YOU MAY HAVE BUYERS REMORSE when this is all said and DONE! And for those people that can’t get pass race, image this “the President a white man” and he was up against Mitt Rubbish WOULD THIS BE A DIFFICULT CHOICE TO MAKE?

Guys! Let's not be malicious! \r\nIt's fact that Lucas won't make another Star Wars in his lifetime anymore, as he already anounced. Why considering that gorgeous series a cash cow. Do you think our children (generally speaking) are watching the series on large scale, as we did? No, not at our scale. So, I guess the new series to come will be a fresh start for a new generation. I am huge movie fan, but in the last months I cannot watch old movies anymore, (maybe due to a lack of patience). In similar way, I observe that another movies fans that I know behieve in the same way. We (the people) are changing, and the movie style changes with us. A new look for Strar Wars in the future due to the evolving cinematographic industry, should look well, in my opinion. Let's try not to see Star Wars just like a George Lucas brand, but like a contribution on world's cultural patrimonium.

I think  Mr Romney believes the only role goverment should have in this country is 1) giving the rich tax breaks,2)deregulatin  ​ g the banks so they a free to gamble with our money.3) Cut all programs to the middle class and poor. 4) deregulate business so they can keep all their earnings in offshore accts so as not to pay ay taxes for the country they make their millions in. 5)make sure education is only affordable for the rich. 6) build up the military and ships even though we already have enough bombs to waist this planet several times over.7) make sure we become a white onky man and wife society. this is a candidate that i dont think anyone for sure can say how many topics he has flip-flop on over the last  8 years.  so who really knows what it is he believes other than his reliegon which believes only if you are mormon can you assend to heaven. yep another nut job chosen by the republicans as we all know they ask many others  to run but all refused except romney lol because they all alreadyknew they didnt have a chance to win.

Never let a crisis go to waste.  It was only a matter of time before all the Prius drives started yelling that any major weather event is really a man made event. \r\n Is there climate change underway - yes - there is always climate change underway.  Does this directly effect our weather - at some point yes but that does not mean that Sandy was a result of climate change.  Is it possible to prove - no and you will never get a consensus. \r\n Is mankind responsible for the global warming and therefore Sandy - I doubt it and its the hight of arrogance to be telling the world that is it is.  BTW - driving a Prius will also not stop nor even slow global warming in the unlikely event that mankind is at the root of the problem.  Not to mention what are you going to do with all these dirty/toxic batteries in about 10 years.

chuckie2000 is right.  There's NO WAY that Obama (or the Administration) could have known that there might be an attack in Benghazi.  No warning at all.  Well, except for the IED thrown at the consulate in April 2012, but that was quite a while before the attack.    \r\n Nope, no warning beyond that.  Well, not including the attack on the International Red cross by an Al Qaeda affiliate in May 2012.   But, Hey, Libya is a dangerous place. \r\n Certainly there was nothing else.  Well, maybe the bomb that blew a hole in the wall around the consulate in June 2012 or perhaps the attack on the British Ambassador also in June, and the British pulling out might have indicated SOME issues, but there was nothing in the tea leaves.  \r\n And if our Ambassador asked for more security, well that was probably because he was a wimp.   There was nothing to say that there even COULD be an attack.  How in the WORLD would the Administration guess that there was significant risk? \r\n No Obama was focused on his tea leaves and they told him nothing.

@aquaman, from 1973 to 1988 the Republicans killed 4 Ambassador to Dem 2 if you want to be retarted about it.Nixon killed 2, Ford 1, and reagan 1. Keep showing your disrespect for the ambassador.See how dumass you sound? No we didn't point a finger at the president, we mourned our losses with respect and dignity. Two things you don't have.
1
Absolutely not. Freaking republican just couldn't resist blaming this on Obama by linking it to Libya. But then again, I'm sure the millions of people that have withered the storm will be very glad the President had their best interest at heart.

The fed could also raise interest rates 1/4 of a point if it feels the economy is doing so well. Why are they broadcasting to the nation that interest rates will remain at current levels (near 0) for the next few years? Because printing cheap money and keeping interest rates at record lows is the primary reason the market is where it is now.  \r\nAs far as Harry Reid protecting our great nation from those evil corporations, if you took off your obvious partisan glasses, you would be able to see that the honus of our economy is a product of both extremes, and yes Reid is one of those extremists. Forgotten already how long it took the current administration to respond in any meaningful way to the BP spill. Or to respond to the Nashville floods or to the Texas firestorm? Your heros are not who they apprear to be. A bi-partisan effort is the only process that is going to get us out of this mess.

I would agree that a lot of shows stay past their sell date, and it's always because the network thinks it can squeeze a few more bucks out of the franchise. Seven years, for some reason, seems to be the point at which things start to turn sour for even the best sitcoms. \r\n  \r\nBut the complaint I usually see made about HIMYM can usually be summed up this way: "Just tell us, already!" Yet how much credit do the show's creators ever get for plotting the path of the show, year-to-year, when there's never any guarantee that they'll be renewed (or little hope of getting enough notice of when it's going to be brought to an end). It ain't easy, and that dynamic almost killed off "Lost," until an end date was brokered with the network. At least in recent years there has been a tendency to allow for short final seasons (e.g. "Chuck" and "Fringe") to wrap up the story. \r\n  \r\nThe bottom line is that HIMYM is still funnier than 90 percent of what passes for comedy on network TV, still inventive in the way it tells its weekly story, and still has a great ensemble cast that appears to be enjoying itself. I'll be sorry to see it go, but it really does seem to be leaving at the right time. I'd read somewhere that there'd been speculation that a ninth season would have been based around "Kids, here's some other funny stories along the way that I forgot to include." Now, THAT would be a case of overstaying one's welcome . . .

Even lyin Willardo's Mexican daddy knew what he would be like when he grew up So he gave him his first name "Willardo" after the large movie rat. He gave him his middle name after an old baseball glove that they found in the family outhouse that was full of shxt. They shortened lyin Willardo's first name to Willard and their last name from Robberos to Romney when they smuggled little lyin Willardo over here from his birthplace in Tijuana. \r\nHe is now known by most people as Mitt Robme. \r\nIt is amazing how these right wing nuts believe that lyin Willardo, in any way is going to do anything but destroy our country again. He is going to eliminate regulations so that his corporate criminal masters can rob and steal from us once again as they did under Bush Bin Lyin and his criminal gang led by President Cheney.

I believe the jest of the comparasion was that Obama did not act quickly enough to the attack on our consulate therefore he is trying to make up for a mistake by acting too early on the weather event.  Sounds like he is trying to play catch up in the president department but IT IS TOO LATE.  Vote him out now.

I'm sorry guys I don't see the things you are saying.  What is wrong with having  someone state what is right or wrong?  Is it wrong to kill babies? Is it wrong for 2 of the same sex to marry?  Is it wrong to hold our government accountable with our money? Is it wrong to have some morals? Is it wrong to say we are going to give account to God? I am asking Christians these questions. If Christians are so liberal in their thinking, what is the rest of the world suppose to do. Do you Christians believe God's words or not? If not, are you really his?

I believe that as a christian no one should force other people to make a choice they are not comfortable with and christians should not judge women for making the choice of abortion or on any marriage equality issue.  Judge ye not lest ye be judged............ let him without sin cast the first stone.......... Since everyone has sinned at some point in their life no matter the severity no one has the right to judge these issues but God

There are local representitives responsible for evacuation and safety determination, not the president as he knows NOTHING about the local community.

Thats the beauty of it.. They are older and have children who continue the story to the next generation or two so new actors are introduced and carry the story forward in time.. Sure I would like to see 100 movies based on different time lines of the Star Wars Universe then remakes of remakes which Hollywood is creating.. Always being left hanging sucks a$$ so do the 7-8-9 and then cap it off and tie up all the loose ends in a final movie 10.. Sure they could do 10 full length films on the Old Republic and 10 on the comming of age of evil Palpatiene and so on and I would watch them all.. They could also reset the story line with Luke's and Han's children's children to show the fight between good and evil is a point of view and eternal and do 10 movies of that.. This is why there are a 100 books based on this universe.. It is a story with no end or beginning.. Thank You George!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ​ !!!!! It is a fact that you can not please everyone so you please yourself and hope that others are entertained..

I agree with Mr. Huckabee - It would be hyprocritic to vote for Obama who supports gay marriage/sex and sodomy and then go to church and "act" like a good Christian....knowing  ​  full well, the Bible is against sodomy.\r\n \r\nA good Christian knows the right person to vote for.

As a Christian I feel the need to elaborate on the meaning by Mr. Huckabee: when voting or taking a stand on any situation as a Christian we are bound by biblical truths, it is no different when choosing a president. 1st: what is this man's position on biblical marriage? (man and woman as God created/ no gay marriage) 2nd: what is this man's position on the un-born children?( no abortion) and 3rd: What is this man's stance on Israel?. Everything else is politics, but these three main factors; we will answer to God for!

Boy, talk about preserving life and you draw out all kinds of venom. Whether you all like it or not, the God of the universe legislated all of this in His Holy Word.

It is man that has changed over the centuries, not God. And not one of you can disprove that either...just another voice...

I think people have forgotten that we are all Americans and that we are a team and as with all teams there are those who have strengths in different ways.  We used to be where the strong takes care of the weak, the sick, the old and now some want to cast out those who they feel are "unfit and unworthy."  \r\nOur level of compassion is low because we think we are getting less of the "pie" and have gone into a financial Darwinism.  This happens when wealth is removed from society (sequestered by the few away from the many) and we all fight for a smaller and smaller share.

Mr. Huckabee needs to remember that in this country, separation of church and state needs to be upheld. As TabbyK has posted below me, you vote for the person that you think that can do the best job of administration of this country. Religious views and personal opinions need to be put on the back burner and everyone needs to concentrate on the task at hand, regardless of who says what. You read the various candidates' platforms, watch debates and campaign performance, etc. and make up your own mind and then go vote!!

What gets me is this...it doesn't matter, you all will vote either Democrat or Republican. It doesn't matter that Democrat and Republican have shafted us all, shafted this, OUR country. Taking our God given rights away by legislative means. You will vote for Democrat or Republican. It doesn't matter that most that is heard is that government is bad, it's the Democrat's fault, it's the Republican's fault. You will vote for one of them anyway. Vote Democrat, vote Republican, go ahead. Forget there are other choices, other views. Forget there are other parties out there. I suppose we are used to shafting...we keep voting for it at EVERY election. So, after election day, after you have voted Democrat or Republican, you know what to do. Assume the position. Grin and "bare it".\r\n\r\nI challenge you, I challenge all of you. Vote using your own mind. Do not vote the typical party views. After all how has that worked for you? Or go ahead and vote the ways you have always voted. Giving Democrats and Republicans the mandate of..they must like the way we do business. By giving us the "business". The populace keeps voting for more of the same, by the same. Break the cycle. Vote for the other guys. Break the cycle of abuse.

Yes, great for Mitik - he is cute - but Thanks to all who helped him and other animals from the storm's fury.  People, yes I feel bad for them, but they knew how to get out of the way and alot did not go.  Here in Florida we are used to these storms, but Sandy was too huge to be believed.  Hopefully, we will not see another one like that any time soon.

I was raised in a Christian church and continue as a Christian.  I think the government should get out of the marriage business, just sell the license to whom ever wants one to keep track of kids and financial responsibilities I don't care who get married, gays, 3 gays, two men and one women, 2 women and one man, a man and his dog and so on.. Let the church decide who they want to marry in their church..If a church wants to marry those other than men/women then OK, but also allow any church to say "no, but you can head down the street and look for a church that does accept your behavior".  Stop harrassing churches for accepting ALL of Gods children and leave people that love each other alone..I thought Republicans wanted to get out of our lives and have a smaller government..NO, they want to intrude into the basics of our freedom to justify their own values and spending OUR tax dollars to do so.  Shame on them.

Joined by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Obama inspected the devastation from superstorm Sandy, flying high over flooded neighborhoods and sand-strewn streets. \r\nAt a community center where people have taken shelter, Obama said one of his top priorities is getting power back on. \r\nChristie said it was "really important" to have the president of the United States in New Jersey.

Being tied in with the highest grossing film of all time, and one of the highest grossing franchises of all time is what you call bereft of ideas? This is a no-lose business decision by Disney. Star Wars is by far a has-been franchise. As can be seen by the comments here, there is no shortage of fans who want more.
1
so, where have you been, in Russia?  What don't you understand about "Our number one priority is to make sure he is a one-term president"?  That means, your congress, more specifically your republican congressmen have done every thing they could to make sure he "fails" or doesn't look good.  It is congress that makes the laws, not the president.  It is congress that must pass a budget, not the president. it is congress that put off paying for two wars so that the next president would take the blame for the huge deficit it would create. Quit being spoon fed, quit having party-affiliated blindness and just plain ignorant.  You would expect fewer people to be working when you are going through a depression and having a congress that refuses to help the American people.  They put POLITICAL PARTY ahead of you.  They upheld a vow to a person over their vows to their constituents and the vow they took upon taking office. I don't care which party you affiliate with, you ultimately should do what is is the best interest of the American people and not your party affiliation.

1)  Absolutely yes.  Just like any other job.  I don't know many, though.  Generally, these types are attempted to be weeded out during any psychological interview.  But, not all places have psych interviews prescreening, too. 2)  Warnings are not available via Motor Vehicles, but your driving record is.  You can see how many times a person has been looked up by the various LE agencies. 3)  I generally don't write tickets unless you are 15 or 20 over, so yes, 8 mph over seems a little unreasonable.  State Troopers are famous for this. 4)  Speeds are set by the local Highway Engineer in small towns.  On state highways they are set by the state based on road, surface, grade, curves, accident history, etc.  Most accidents have excessive speed as the number one contributing factor, so it's not always the varying speed of drivers. 5)  I don't personally know of anywhere that has a "mandate" to be more strict to raise revenue or that has "quotas", but I am sure that there are some cities/towns where this is true.  I have heard that the South is the worst for this. \r\n Hope this helps!

I can recall reading magazine interviews with Lucas way back when Star Wars was in theaters. He said  he envisioned a series of three trilogies, with the last three continuing the stories of  Luke, Leia, and Han Solo. Hopefully, some elements of his original idea will make it into the new movies, and the original actors can reprise their roles.

Going against the grain here...I DO NOT want to see this legalized...VT father--your statements are very true:  :"carcinogens, reduced motivation, short-term memory impairment, reduced ability with moderately difficult logical tasks, and lower accuracy of self-evaluation - which means user think they are performing better than reality." \r\nI'd like to add a COMPLETE lack of motivation.  Would you want a pothead operating heavy machinery?  In a factory setting?  OUT ON THE ROAD?  How quickly can a stoner react in an emergency situation?  Do you want this crap around your children?  Not me.  Most employers insist you pass a drug test - they do it for a reason.  They are required to provide a safe work environment.   \r\nYea, it's all cool and neat to say, Legalize It...until you think through all the ramifications.  And, yes, I have experienced all of the above with someone I am no longer with.

I loved that trilogy, but, since they are considered "Expanded Universe", Lucas has always maintained that they are basically a parallel universe and have no real bearing on the story HE wants to tell.  Shame - TZ did a bang-up job with that series and Kevin J.

Another taken out of context by the dems Romney plan.  Actually, Romney listened to people who had had to deal with FEMA after disasters in the past.  I had that pleasant experience after Katrina.  Obama did sign to rip almost a billion out of FEMA.  Now he is doing photo ops with them.  Romney wanted to shrink FEMA down to its essentials, information, organization of relief efforts... and then give the rebuilding money back to the states and local governments to disburse as best and without 12 layers of Fed red tape.  After Katrina, the most frustrating thing as a person, and watching the local governments deal with them, was trying to get through the FEMA administrative beaurocracy.. it is amazing how much time and money are wasted in the current set up.  Thanks.

I'd love that idea but if it were left up to the scientists---the guys with the actual facts---our society would drastically change as we know it. The only reason it hasn't is because the guys on the political side want their money---even at the expense of the safety of us as a species. In other words, I fully support what you are suggesting but it will never happen because the idea of politics long ago changed---rather than being something that protected us and made us prosper---it is all about agendas and the almighty dollar. Not for us as a country but just those in power.

Oh, for God's sake! Vote for Obama or go to Hell? Really Huck? It is a wonder that the far "Christian" right has any credibility. From supporting slavery, denouncing the women's right to vote amendment, standing in the way of Civil Rights laws, Anti-union, Anti-social programs that help the veterans, the elderly and those have been victimized by disasters. Not to mention the Christian-evangelica  ​ l- Nationalist Right wing that has attempted to block Gay Rights at every turn as well as the religilous freedoms of those different from them. How can anyone take them seriously with a past record of such disgrace and shame?

I haven't seen the ad but what he said even though isn't "politically correct" is "God correct". There are issues, for a person who claim to be a Christian, that are not negotiable. Of course, we are living in a time where many things are "upside down" as the Scriptures says, a time when "good will be called wrong or bad, and wrong or bad will be called good". I know, many of the Christian "stuff" are old "stuff", and are not for such an "enlightened" time like ours, but something that we shouldn't forget, ( I'm writing to those who are believers in God, in moral values, right and wrong, eternal and unshakable truths, life after death, etc), we shouldn't cast our vote for those who offer free stuff, easy money, but lack all the moral values which are the important things after all. A brief look at history will tell us how all the " great empires " of the past had fallen, a common denominator was the moral decay that happened.  We are withnessing this in our time, but at a lightning speed. So, brothers and sisters, and all those who are believers, don't get fooled. Cast your vote in a "God correct" way.

He is absolutely right. What is happening in the USA today is the same as what happened in Sodom and Gomorrah, and at the time of the Flood. This is the last chance for America before judgment. Gods word is the only truth that exists today, (the problem is that only a few are actually reading it, it is the only book that spells out the outcome of man's plight and PROVES it by the prophecies that have been fulfilled through out human history) and no other faith can claim that, PERIOD. Wake up America, this is the last train out. It's not that we can't have four more years of the same, it's that GOD  won't put up with it. We think Sandy was bad, you don't know what BAD really is. Vote your conscience this time.

If Exxon could just raise prices at will.. why wouldn't they already have done so?  Last I checked, benevolence in pricing wasn't part of the corporate strategy.\r\n\r\nSeems like an awful lot of kids go to public school even though private and homeschooling are options...  Public schools vary widely depending on where you are.  More affluent areas keep their public schools flush with resources and highly skilled teachers.  They also largely contain households that care about their kids education.  When you filter all the other factors out, that's the main predictor.  Public/private, rich/poor, a household that values education tends to have their kids do well.

To the author: Thanks for the solid advice and information. Upon reading the responses, it appears each wants to tell his or her own story, not heed the advice. Want a stable retirement? Start with your first job, save 10 % of what you make using one of the many competent and qualified investment counselors available in any city - not your mother, brother or cousin. Never touch it. When you reach retirement age, if you have been employed all those years, you will have a comfortable retirement. Then, with funds to do whatever you want, be prepared mentally to do what many retired persons do - go back to work - maybe part time - to avoid the boredom of life without purposeful work, a reason to get up every day. I hope your health is good and your life is filled with love. There are many things more important than a million dollars in the bank at age 65+.

Please remove the bratty child, Honey Boo Boo and her obnoxious parent. I'm from the South and I can't stand the exagerated accent and over the top stupidity this show has. Be assured, any Southerner with any Southern pride would not watch such a stupid show. This is not what we teach our children to be.  \r\n  \r\nI am so sick and tired of the Kar"trashians". The only people who care about this show are "bimbos and wanta be's, not anyone who has to live in the real world. So, they've got tons of money. So What. The love of money is the "root" of all evil and I do believe these folks are evil in many ways. They don't give a flip about humanity; even with all their "pretend" philantrophy. Sure, they do shows for this or for that to look like they care, but if they really cared, they would get their hands dirty. How about volunteering in a third world country to help young women who have no rights in a male dominated society.  How about helping people in America's Appalacian region who have little or no food and no jobs. There are many hurting people in this country  who have nothing through no fault of their own.  \r\nEveryone in America was not born with a Silver Dollar in their fist.  "He to whom much is given, much is required".

Trying to convince rational people to make candidate  choices based upon some self-professed 'Christian' manifesto emanating like an infection from the ultra right wing Tea Party miscreants is simply beyond comprehension. I suggest you take your religious morality play to some fantasyland movie studio where you can act out some biblical stories to your heart's content

His Social security number is from a state he has never lived in or born in, research  it , if you have the balls, research it about how he started his college career in California.. Read Obamas two books and see how his father Hated America.. Look at Michelle's record as the angry Black woman against America and How she is tied to Chicago's  TIM Gietenter Family and why Both of them lost their law licenses to practice...How steeped he is in making America in Obamas fathers dream... yes the stupid and ignorant are waking up ..thank you Donald.. and if this doesn't make someone step back and look at who is in the White House..then stupid and ignorant means you... Have you read the First 400 pages of the Afforable Health Care Bill??? I bet not... Have you read Obamas Budget that was sent to the congress..

Yes, Super Beast, that and the truck stops and back alleys.....David, really, allow me to ask you what you are personally doing for those of us in New York with the damage from Sandy....can you honestly say you are giving a portion from every bl0w j0b you perform to help out?  If not, than may I suggest you do so......thanks, your support will be greatly appreciated and all the men will love knowing that their contribution will be helping more than just you....LMAO

In the past, Our Great Nation was blessed by GOD because we were founded on and maintained Biblical morals and values. This is no longer the case as this nation now promotes and allows the killing of innocent babies (as did Pharaoh of Egypt and King Herod who was attempting to kill The Christ Child) and embraces homosexuality (the very reason GOD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah). These two acts of mankind (abortion and homosexuality) are among the most DETESTABLE ABOMINATIONS AGAINST GOD! Anyone who believes that GOD will bless this nation while we allow these ABOMINATIONS AGAINST GOD to continue is simply ignorant of THE TRUE WORD OF GOD (The Bible).  \r\n“Christian” means = “CHRIST like”. JESUS CHRIST IS THE TRUE WORD OF GOD (The Bible)….. \r\nJOHN 1:14 “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.” \r\nPROVERBS 29:26 Many seek the ruler’s (political leaders) favour; But every man’s judgment cometh from the LORD. \r\nDEUTRONOMY 28:45 Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep His commandments and His statutes which He commanded thee: JAMES 4:4 Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world (politically correct) is the enemy of God. II JOHN verse 9 Whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. II JOHN verse 10 If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine (THE TRUE WORD OF GOD,The Bible), receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed: II JOHN verse 11 For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds. \r\nDid you hear THE TRUE WORD OF GOD? A True Christian will not even wish “God speed” to a politician who is in favor of abortion and homosexuality rights, let alone vote for that politician! Any self proclaimed Christian or anyone else who desires to be “a friend of the world” (politically correct) when it comes to abortion and homosexuality rights “is an enemy of GOD” and is not being Christ like (Christian) at all!  Anyone who votes for or supports in any way a politician who is against or opposes THE WORD OF GOD “in even one point” (this includes abortion and homosexuality), is a “partaker of ALL of his evil deeds” and in THE EYES OF GOD is “guilty” of performing every abortion and every homosexual act! \r\nJAMES 2:10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. \r\nAccording to THE TRUE WORD OF GOD WHO IS JESUS CHRIST: Mike Huckabee is RIGHT!

V_L\r\n\r\nWe also don't need an Obama who is a caretaker for the Nanny Socialist State and the wonderful world of Big government watch dogs dictating our daily lives who take from the productive side of society by crippling the producers, giving the proceeds and profits away in pieces by redistributing the liquidated assets to non-productive moochers of society. . The U.S. has declined in economic freedom from 10th place to 18th place under this administration. I guess you can't live or operate without the help of the government. How did this country survive for 200 years without FEMA? Unbelievable how statist you and the rest of your Marxist cronies are.

CHRISTIE OF NEW JERSEY TALKS LIKE THE MAFFIA USED TO, HE CAN'T EVEN TALK LIKE A LEADER, HE TALKS LIKE A THUG, STUPID SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY WORD HE KNOWS.  ARCHIE BUNKER WAS SMARTER THAN HE IS.

romney and huckabe are nothing more than muslims, they act the sameway and they ar muslims,or mormons, no difference, better yet they are both christian crooks, and HOD said that lieing is a ten comments!  they are the reason that the USA is in such a mess, lets kick all republicans out and let them go back in history and see who are theiggest crooks, elephants, or donkeys, and ypu will find the elephants want to stuff their pockets full of money, while the donkeys try to help the people in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!

I don't know about Romney but I'd like to see FEMA shut down completely. Disaster relief, if any, should come from the State, not the Federal government.  When are people going to wake up and realize that we're broke? We can't continue funding everything at their current levels. And taxing the so-called "rich" more is not the answer.

We had 10-20ft. seas in FL on Sunday, and I've never seen it like that living here for over 20 years!  On Sat. waves may have been worse-surfers were actually shooting the curl like in Hawaii.  That NEVER happens here.  Some poor surfer got his board broken and it gashed his neck.  The surf was over A1A (highway) and into homes and businesses in certain counties.  Millions of dollars of damage was done to the beaches, and several have been closed because they essentially don't exist anymore.  And we didn't even get hit by the storm.\r\n \r\nMy heart goes out to those in the Northeast who have lost their homes and their livelihoods and who are suffering even now with losses, power outages, flooding, and cold.  I pray things get back to normal soon for them.  If our hurricane experiences in FL are any guide-and we've had quite a few-it takes quite a while to restore power and clean up the debris and water after a storm like this.  Hopefully, in such a populated area, however, things will move more quickly for the folks up there.

can't believe over 74 people disagree with what you said but it shows the horrors of the last 35 years of Republican neo-religious-fanati  ​ cal control over the Department of Education and in certain state legislatures like Texas where they believe the earth is only 9000 years old and dinosaurs never existed. Obviously, Romney is a LIAR who should be ashamed to run for public office but isn't because of all the brainwashed morons willing to vote for him.

After reading these comments, people really really need to understand what it means for a company or incorporated government to go through bankruptcy.  It does not mean going out of business at all.  People who think GM got a great deal with line their pockets to turn up the assembly line money... should go try to get a job lined up at Ford, Kia, Hyundi, or somewhere else.  The instant profit money is already gone, and the below cost unit sales are going to catch up in the next year or so at the end of the current production cycle.  Unless the economy makes a good upturn, but then GM will just lag behind the others.  Chrysler used a smaller loan to invest in itself, so they should be ok.  Ford has good corporate structure so they will do great if the economy picks up.  GM should not have been pulled out of having to restructure their dinosaur corporate infrastructure... bad move in the long run.

I often wonder why the media covers such losers as Michael Brown, Sara Palin, Michele Backman, Ann Coulter, Donald Trump and many others who have nothing constructive to contribute except their idiotic blabber. \r\n  \r\nI know that if I were living in New Jersey, I would definitely expect the President to be  "johnny on the spot" with assurances of helping all those affected by this disaster. His sincere concern would be paramount in showing his leadership, unlike "W" did with Katrina.

Max said; "It's funny how some Republicans rage against the federal Government, but just like the rebellious teen, when things go south they run to Mom and Dad for help and support. Suddenly all those boundaries and chores put upon them make sense and they grow up a little."\r\n \r\n This, from a guy with what looks like a blow up doll for an avi, that has more common sense than he does.

"Nothing like a Republican  to take advantage of a program he criticizes." \r\n  \r\nNo worries, Greg. I expect the Etch-A-Sketch candidate will call a press conference any minute now to explain how the liberal media have distorted his comments about wanting to cut FEMA.

Romney lost by a longshot, kids. The public knows that Dubya ruined us and then left the debt and destruction to be paid by Obama. Republicans in Congress stonewalled us to make sure Obama didn't have the funds or cooperation to recover us. WE KNOW THIS. No one will intelligently vote for Romney and we will be cleaning Republicans out of the Congress for good. The party's over-- the Grand Old Party, that is.

you want to talk about obama and vacations bush took the most vacations out of any pres. obama may have wanted to cut a billion from fema to help out debt but he didnt want to cut fema down to a state level and private companies that like insurance companies will fight for a profit then for repairing storm damage

I'm not a republican though I was years ago when they were more on the sane side of things. Unfortunately the people that the more sane non-democrats support always end up getting squished one way or another - and in ways that I suspect wouldn't always hold up to scrutiny. At this point I'd love to see Jesse Ventura up there and win - he's as loony as the rest but at least he's not a coward, doesn't support the wealthy and is entertaining!

1st off Huckabee did not judge anyone. He has simply stated that if we as a nation want to avoid the wrath of God, God's judgement then we need to vote for those who support God's will.\r\nWant to know what God's will is, read the Bible. In doing so you will also learn why Huckabee made the statement.

JanineC,\r\nI understand your position, and in a perfect 'Pollyanna' world such a dictum would be the norm and all would be right with the world. However, the fact of the matter is that we live in a completely homogenized society, not a pasteurized one. In a democratic and free society that means that equal citizenship will and should encompass, accept and respect a myriad of value systems; whether they be personal, religious, ethnic or sexually orientated. To abridge any group their rights under law would be to undermine the principals upon which our nation was founded. While the nuclear family is still strong and been traditionally aspired to by most people, other lifestyles, living situations and mutually symbiotic relationships have always been a part of our societal equation. Moralizing against those with whom we do not agree is to deny another's rightfull personal choices and paths to happiness, and it does nothing to grow a society... it always divides it. \r\nPeace ~

As with vaccines, evolution, the moon landing, smoking causing cancer, the terrorist attacks of 9/11, and the non-existence of perpetual motion machines, climate change is not contentious among the actual scientists.\r\n\r\nJohn Tyndall (1800s) established the infrared absorption of CO2.\r\n\r\nGustav Arrhenius suggested CO2 (emitted from volcanoes) could actually warm the Earth and changes in CO2 may have been responsible for ice ages and warming periods:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.aip.org/h  ​ istory/climate/co2.h  ​ tm\r\n\r\nThe Bell Telephone Hour mentioned the potential for GW in 1958:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.c  ​ om/watch?v=m-AXBbuDx  ​ RY\r\n(Note that Frank Baxter was a professor of English, not any kind of scientist, but this was before climate politicization.)\r\n\r\nIn 1979, the JASONS released a report that GW could have serious consequences and called for more study. (Not able to find a link online at the moment)\r\n\r\nIsaac Asimov said AGW was a serious problem in 1989:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.c  ​ om/watch?v=o6tSYRY90  ​ PA\r\n(It's YouTube, but this is Asimov in his own words - he was not a climate scientist, but a chemist)\r\n\r\nOf course,  a lot more research has been done in the meantime, but the work has been habitually misrepresented by the denialists.

Less than a week before the presidential election, Christie will host Obama in New Jersey to survey Sandy damage. The governor created a buzz after saying this week that he had no intention of bringing the GOP nominee to the Garden State to survey storm damage first-hand.Folks don’t know the situation here following the storm,” a Christie adviser told POLITICO when asked if the governor is unhappy with the GOP nominee \r\nChristie has been a frequent campaigner and fundraiser for Romney, appearing with him most recently in Ohio. Christie cancelled campaign appearances for Romney in Nevada that had been slated to occur on Tuesday after it was clear the storm was headed to his state. \r\nThe governor told Fox News that he has bigger things to worry about than the campaign. \r\n“I have no idea, nor am I the least bit concerned or interested,” he said when asked if Romney would visit. “I’ve got a job to do here in New Jersey that’s much bigger than presidential politics, and I could care less about any of that stuff.”

What you need to do is find 5 resources of legitimate people who are doing well in the business and find 5 other resources that may try to prove that the business is a scam. Then let your intelligence decide.\r\nI closed down my construction business because I did my research and I made sure I knew how to market my online business correctly. Market your business as a professional, and you can sell anything.\r\nMuch luck to you all

Thanks God! Finally, someone ( or they ) realized that good TV should be that, good TV, not that garbage that's on almost every channel! Please get rid of those so-called comedies, they are so gross, so disgustingly lower class, and so stupid ( I guess for a stupid audiences as well ) audiences. I can't stand the "How I met your mother"and so on. I also ponder at those writer's mentality! But I also understand that sometimes there are no choices as far as TV directives or monetary issues, Nevertheless, those shows should be expunged, totally from the air, leaving a clean air for the future.(Don't those directives know what ii is good or not, PLEASE?)

Shut the **** up Trump! Your bag o' **** is so deep and so foul that YOU make me ashamed that we live in the same country. You're a sad show pony with no decency to just do what is right without making a spectacle out of it to glorify your own persona. Donate the money anyway, don't be a show boat. The more you pull **** publicity stunts like this, the bigger fool you make of yourself. JUST DONATE THE MONEY ANYWAY!

These politicians have NO RIGHT under our government's ORIGINAL rules to USE religion in making PHONY LAWS and PHONY STATEMENTS like Huckabee's. Some americans are simply phony. \r\n \r\nAnd an even bigger number obviously carry their phony water. Stupid, ignorant, polarized idiots that have NO CONCEPTION what AMERICAN freedom means and what it takes to preserve it.

No kidding "VolckerFan" The new standard for us men is to work a full time job and then come home to do more or we are selfish "Archie Bunkers" and demonized on daytime TV all day.

people, understand that the Mormons believe God had more sons, that Jesus was not the only one.  The bible says God gave his ONLY begotton son to die on the cross.  They added inserts into our sacred bible that deal with the Joseph Smith legacy.  Now tell me you want Romney in office..............  ​ .......  I don't  care WHO is running against him, they mock our bible

YES, get rid of this show... its not the same without the man CHARLIE SHEEN.

What started as a noble cause is fast becoming a joke.

In the aftermath of the storm I think its a wise decision to do what he's doing concerning Halloween. And on another note I think its good he has thrown politics out the window as well, To deal with the issues that our going on in his state. And one more thing Its good to see Mr. Christie and the President working together on this catastrophe, Maybe if we could get both sides to work together like this we'd get more done in this country...

The number one kind of clutter you don't need is the crap put out there by MSN, especially when the dipsticks don't even include an article.  Typical slip-shod MSN.

I agree.... The show is NOT the same it used to be. Aside from the obvious Charlie being gone, the show is lacking a vision and any depth. None of the episodes make sense (i.e. episode about Walden having a monkey for a brother?). None of the characters have a clear direction (i.e. Jake and the army? what happpened with Eldridge? He signed up for the army too!). And because of this confusion and lack of.... anything.... the original characters who are still part of the show have lost their roles! What happened to Judith and Herb or Evelyn? The show is NOT what it used to be. They are trying to force laughs out of their viewers by trying to hard, but it's not working =(( We need Charlie back... from the dead.... or the show to be buried with him!

This is just another attempt by the left's media service to try to distract the world from the real issue at hand and that is the failed, single term presidency of Barry Obama.\r\n \r\nWe're going to stop him just in time before he walks out the door with the rest of our grandchildren's money.

How is it possible to act too fast? Plan as far ahead as you can, be prepared to get a headstart before the damage is done is common sense at the very least. Clearly some people are not happy unless they can b*tch about something, anything really and point fingers and act foolish. All the while Americans are in need of help, what are these whiners doing? Nothing but flapping their gums, they aren't helping anyone at all.

Huckabee would vote for the Devil before voting for a Black President. He comes across as a racist.

It's time for this show to go. Can't say I've ever watched it so why would I care if it was cancelled.
1
I think that if the Producers of Two and a Half Men were smart...they would find a way to bring Charlie back...even in a Ghost kind of way....Ashton Kutcher is not funny, he's annoying. If you can't get Charlie Sheen back, Cancel the show..It SUCKS !!!

I must side with FATCAT.  A special Tax on every word\r\nMG utters that is completely partisan or Bullsmear,\r\nand this financial crisis would be solved yesterday!

Shows how much you know about the Mormons!  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints was given the name Mormon(s) because we not only believe in the Bible but also in the Book of Mormon which was given to Joseph Smith by the angel Moroni.  Mormon was a prophet from the Book of Mormon who abridged all the scriptures from many prophets. These prophets were guided by God from Jerusalem around 600bc to north America and the Book of Mormon accounts their dealings with God and a personal account with Jesus Christ after his death and resurrection.  The record ends about 400ad.  Want to know more, the facts, check out mormon.org and check it out for yourself! Oh, and by the way, I'm Mormon and a Christian!  Christ is my savior, my everything and all that I do is try my hardest to follow his commandments.

Yes, I have to say that Halloween was one of those things that proved to be much different in reality over the perception I'd built up through the years from my long distant perspective in Australia. I grew up on all those American TV programs from the 60's and 70's, so maybe they were a truer reflection of society back then, rather than today. I can't say, obviously. My wife, who's American, tells me that safety considerations at night, litigation fears, poisoning scares, and the fact Orlando is such a transient place, all contribute to why Halloween is such a bust here by and large. The neighborhood we found that's proven such a jewel is a very family orientated area that's an enclosed estate, so that sense of being an enclosed place with lots of kids is probably what makes this neighborhood the rarity that it is here. I love it. Not having been through it as a kid myself, I get to go through it now as a 53-year old watching my children have fun (yeah, I started late having children) In fact, when they're getting tired, I'm the one pushing them along saying, c'mon, just one more house, just one more house!' My daughter's going along as Hermione Granger this year, while the boy has decided it's all getting a little old hat and wants to go as a hippie. I think I can squeeze another 3 - 4 years out of our girl, then I'll have to borrow someone else's kids!

Respond too quickly?  That depends on the response.  Frankly, I haven't paid any attention to Obama's response to the storm (because that Chicago politician has nothing to say that is worth hearing), but it's always better for leaders to respond sooner than later, though I personally would prefer that politicians just butt out and let the first responders do their jobs.

well can't say there isn't some validity in his statement. we can only HOPE that the victims will spend their aid money on things they need rather than want but since people on welfare spend their money and even sell their food stamps to others, can't blame the man one bit.

Obama wants it that's not the point the point is that Romney will not support fema he will give tax break to his masters and tax us more add 2 trillion to the dept just so he can play gi Joe and  that wont count the lives of our kids that will be lost and the cost of his war he wants so bad then look at all the jobs he will send to china and its funny he try to tell us that Obama sold Chrysler and was sending jobs to china look it up it was a right out lie and a fraud on the American people a scare tactic  do one good thing in your life don't vote for a conman  and a bully  he lies to you  and you bite your hooked and the next thing you find your in a frying pan with a squeeze of lemon

I have heard of that.  I've done a similar thing on a small scale by making a meatloaf mix and wrapping it in grape leaves laid over some coals raked off the fire and covered in same. \r\n  Putting a hamburger pattie(or sliced strips of chicken breast), cut potatoes, onions and carrots (add a little oil for chicken, and season to taste) in a tinfoil envelope and tossing it in on top of the coals (turn gently one or twice). Makes simple and tasty campfire meal.  Good to see you! :)

To the point and accurate as well.  And in this case, her stupidity began with getting drunk as a major storm was in progress, a time when one needs to be in control.

Without Lucas there would be no Star Wars, period. It has always bugged me when people complaining about something that they didn't create. When handling something liis I bring up The Beatles and how they didn't do to many stupid things with that.  No one is perfect so the Apple store and the Maical Mystery Tour movie are not to bad with me.  Opinions are fine but don't tell someone how to raise their kids is kind of how I see it.

Politics aside, Gov. Christie runs his state with an iron hand, but his decisions seem to be always sound and in the interest of his state residents.  Hats off to him even though we'll vote for different presidential candidates next Tuesday.

it seems like some of these people (julio and emily) are out of touch with reaityI worked for 8 years with one employer and when my employer squandered the profits and had to lay 25% of the professional workforce off to cover his screw ups I had no choice but to use my savings and 401 (k) to get me through to the next position which did not happen for 6 months, even worked at Target stocking shelves during that time. \r\n  \r\nIn 22 years of being out of school I have had two jobs that lasted 8 years and couple months each and in between that time had four contract positions lasting a year or so....do you consider that job hopping.  I consider it survival. \r\n  \r\nNow the employer I am with (8 years mind you ) just announce layoffs but has no with the fact that he has invested in various opportunities that have not panned out.  Mean while our bread and butter clients have gone elsewhere due to his lack of attention to them....

The constitution clearly states that the President of the United States of America must be a natural born citizen.  No President of the United States should ever deny showing the required documentation.

We went through coastal flooding during Huricane Ike in 2008, and it was awful.  I just hope people there get more help and support from the SBA and FEMA than we did.  People here are still in court trying to get insurance claims paid.  The wind insurers claimed damage was caused by rising flood waters, the flood insurers claimed the damages were caused by wind driven waters...result nobody paid and homeowners and business owners suffered.

Well Bush left the office in 2009 with a 5.1 trillion dollar deficit which is now down to 1.3 trillion dollars.... Sad facts are that the republican party had spent 28 years outsourcing jobs to lower paid employee type countries like China and South America.... That was their fix....\r\nAs a result you don't drive american made anymore.... Your chevy cars are toyota and the smaller trucks are Isuzu.... Ford uses Mazda.... Crysler uses a few parts made here and other from overseas.... Vehicles today are imported in parts and then assembled here.....Your fruits and vegetables are grow mostly out of the country too.... You know with an almost equal land mass China has 6.7 people to the United States one person.... And their average income is $14,000 per year for long days and a 6 day work weeks in most manufacturing possitions.... But hey don't beleive me though and wiki those facts for yourselves....\r\nAmerica's productivity has declined seriously over the years due these facts.... You can dream like a rockstar but you can't get out and do a job that pays peanuts.... Ya know I make $13 an hour and 40 a week and still my income is but $27,000 per year yet I don't bitch about it though the average American salary is $42,979 per year....

We shouldn't care about a presidents' religion, what's important is their values ,what kind of decision they make once they are in power. Obama says he is a christian but what he does is not realy what a true christian or believer would do. America is christian country,its founders were christians(God fearing people )what we see now is far from that. We have gone away from God as a nation and we need a president who will not compromise on the most important issues when it comes to our faith:life,marriage ,family.

Of course the stores should have remained open. Pennsylvania has the most screwed up system for\r\nliquor sales anywhere & should have gotten out of the business years ago. It would be better operated by private enterprise, not by the state, but that won't happen because too many PLCB employees with political connections don't want to lose their "cushy" jobs & benefits. Why in the world should a state government be involved in selling booze ?

Regardless of if you agree with this man's politics, you have to give it to him that he does genuinely care about his constituents. Otherwise, he would have said "No FEMA help!

First off, I'm not for Obama, But, Mr. Brown; what right do you have to criticize Obama for being too soon? You need to go look at the 9th ward and tell all of us what you have done! This is the United States of America and by now, long before now, that whole place should have been re-built! We let Americans float around in the waters, and lay dead on American streets. We watched this on all news channels. If you are going to place blame; please look at the administration you sat under while this still drags on. Please keep that type of mud slinging to your self.

No Obama didn't act to fast. If he had waited til AFTER the huricane the way Bush and this A-hole Brown did, the death toll would be alot more than 39. Brown, obviously republican, would point fingers either way, too fast, too slow. Last minute political blame game. Brown has no business opening his mouth after his track record.

The catholic nuns really helped turn this race around for Obama, in my opinion, when they started their bus tour to explain to people how Lyin Ryan and Lyin Willardo were going to destroy medicare and healthcare as they know it. \r\nWhen nuns and bishops speak out against the criminal repukes, they should be congratulated for it. \r\nThis "Baindead" pick of Ryan is going to cause lyin Willardo, the Mexican Mormon Moron to lose the nun and bishop votes. They HATE Ryan and his lies. \r\nAny senior or anyone else on medicare who votes for a pathetic, psychotic, facist repuke for president is cutting their own throat. Your medicare costs will go up about $6,000 a year, and your secondary insurance will skyrocket. This is according to the CBO. The National Council of Bishops who support the lying repukes only because of abortion, have highly cr iticized the Ryan voucher plan as being cruel and harsh and can't support it. It gives an average $250,000 tax cut to millionaires while cutting medicare. \r\nThere is a group of nuns travelling around the country who call themeselves "Nuns on a Bus". Their goal is to correct all the false information and lies spread by Paul Ryan that his plan is going help anyone but the wealthiest 2%. They also claim the the Ryan plan is a disaster for the poor and needy people in this country and that you should vote against the republicans. \r\nOnce the medicare funds get into the hands of the repukes corporate criminal backers, it will be destroyed. \r\nRepukes are typical right wing dunces that listen to Fox Lies with Eric Bowleggs, David Axxwipes and The Sludge. Even Miss Piggy has more brains than these braindead repukes, as she knows that Faux News is only a pretend news channel and is only a poor excuse for a comedy channel. \r\nThere had to be a reason that Rick the Dick Sanitarium and Nut Gingerhead, the criminal lobbyist both agreed that lyin Willardo is the worst person to ever run for president in U.S. history, that he can't be trusted and will destroy our country. \r\nThey both brought Etch A Sketch boards to their news conferences to prove their points.

I think the big guy represents the United States government and the little guy represents the governments of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Venezuala, Cuba, Turkey, Granada, Vietnam, and maybe a few more.  Russia is not in the fight.  They are the fans just watching.  When all these little countries that have been run over by "the greatest nation on earth" and the "wealthiest nation" and of course, the "superpower" come together they may deliver the knock out punch.  Before that happens, maybe we, the American voters, need to deliver a similar punch at the polls on Nov 6.  PLEASE VOTE OUT ALL INCUMBENTS.

It could be better if FEMA is restructured & reorganized under an ex-Army General from Engineers with staffing from all states with periodic training centrally but deployment in states to be near the disaster points. In the event of bigger disaster all teams of states could be joined to handle centrally rather than individually. Romney opinion to give responsibility to states will again involve contractors like defense services, profits not philanthropic role expected of them. In fact states could do better but politics & vested interests do not allow its better performance. FEMA is under evolution and development, as an experiment could be tried in more vulnerable state with Republican governance to build a model for other states unlike Romney who never offered to other states during his Governorship of Massachusetts as he professes. This point is certain that whatever preparations are made, it will be less than nature fury and only reduce damages and dangers to human life. With advance warning & alert to people, it will be better & safe if supplies like gas in homes, electricity and water are switched off to avoid fires & other disasters with less or scanty staff to deal with emergencies. It will be still better to have Public Mass Rapid Transportation system connected in network with Central America away from coasts to shift human population to safety in case of Sandy like disasters.

I absolutely agree with him.  And, I am very proud to see this Governor and our President work together for the better of the residents of this State that have been stricken by this storm.  God bless us everyone!

this coming from an equestrian expert put in charge of FEMA despite any experience?  Thank Goodness Romney wasn't president for this one,  he wants to cut all FEMA funding. Privatize the industry so his buddies can get rich off of tragedies such as this...  When " brownie " was in charge people sat on their roofs waiting for rescue, food and water..Maybe only the people that can afford help should get it from now on, that would make the republicans very happy....

I know of that bar and although it is true that you can get drinks with real human toes in it (yes, I did say 'toes' because there is more than one in the bar so that you can take shots with your buddies), the toes did not come from an actual dead body. They came from people who had severe frostbite and had to have some of their toes amputated.\r\nThe really gross part about it is that when you take your shot your supposed to catch the toe in your mouth and spit it back into the glass. It absolutely doesn't get grosser than that...

Yea, Obama, you should have WAITED to see how it 'all turned out' before reacting to it.  Maybe wait until Madison Square Garden is filled with people living in it (because of not being evacuated) before forming a plan, then wait two weeks before actually putting it into action.

All of the things Obama did was paid for by those of who worked for years and paid our taxes. His aid all came from the pockets of the working people. He spent, spent, spent on things that only helped those who wanted handouts. The jobs he opened are all paid for by taxpayer money. That does not help the economy at all. The student loans were given to people who were not able to get jobs because they went to school but did not check to see if any one would hire a liberal arts graduate. Again paid for by the taxpayers, or the working class.
1
I'm sorry but how ridiculous can you get. No one is a bigger animal lover than I am, but this is totally ridiculous. People are starving, living under bridges, no jobs, no income and PETA wants us to install a memorial to fish who died in an accident. At that rate we should put up a memorial every place a human has died in an accident, and the same for horses, dogs, cats, etc.. I personally have rescued animals from PETA because they didn't know what the hell they were doing. They crossed over the bridge from sanity 50 years ago.

Mike is so craven, I was living in the FL panhandle when he was building his 3 million dollar mansion in Destin,FL. Huckabee claimed in a local newspaper, that he was relocating there from AR because the people in Destin reflect  his values, yeah those of the wealthy...
1
I take it you make over $200,00 at that FEMA job because otherwise this makes no sense you think it's okay for a millionaire to pay actually 14% tax and those of making less than $250,000 per household, personally our household income was $78,000 which is plenty in my opionion, we live a nice life and  take a couple of vacations a year,  to pay more than he did. So since he believes all of the ever so generous people of America should step and help out their fellow man in times of crisis why doesn't he whip out his huge wallet and donate a million dollars to Sandy relief??? Oh yeah their the 47% looking for a hand out and we would hate to encourage that!!! What planet do people like you come from Kolob because that's where the founder of his church came here from look it up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ​ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ​

I don't agree with other posters about bringing back Charlie.  The show was becoming tedious even when he was on it.  The arrogant, misogynist, booze hound character, was wearing thin as was Jake's dim-witted "fartmeister.".  Jon Cryer's Alan was occasionally more interesting but you can only take pity on a whiny loser for so long.   Ashton Kutcher's character Walden is merely a reworking of  Sheen's character, i.e. rich slob who's got money to burn.  I don't blame the actors but it seems like the writer's just can't come up with anything new.  It's time for this show to go bye-bye.

I need to make a clarification on Episode I......  The Force is not an STD and it isn't a religion.  Jedi and Sith are religions and they both possess a "magical" way to control a force (The Force) by means of a genetic trait found in their blood.  In a publication that I read, it appears that all persons in the Star Wars Universe all have the mitoclorians in their blood.  Some have more, some have less.  The more you have, the more you have the ability to control The Force.  I do have to admit though that Episode I did suck overall.  Darth Maul was the only guy that was really cool. \r\n  \r\nEpisode II.......  Stormtroopers started out as Clone Troopers who were clones of Jango Fett, not Boba Fett.  Boba Fett was a clone of Jango Fett too and was given to Jango to be his son. \r\n  \r\nEpisode III......  In the original trilogy remember Obiwan Kenobe saying that Vader is more machine than he is man?  Well, the end of Episode III supported that.  I don't know how else they could make Anikan Skywalker more machine than man, if they didn't go Frankenstein on him.

I stopped watching DWTS the first time Sabrina was eliminated. When I found out that she was going to be dancing again, I decided to watch it again. Sabrina was voted to be on the show by her fans, I find it strange that they would not vote to keep her on. Who I think could have been eliminated last night could have been between 3 couples: Val & Kelly, Emmett & Cheryl or Max & Kirsty.  After what happened last night, I guess I will not be watching the show anymore, I believe it is rigged and it sucks.

How will this impact on the Star Wars game.  Unlike Guild Wars and World of War(craft), Star Wars is based on the movie, but has itself evolved from it tree.  The fruit does fall far from the tree.  Will Disney put capital into the Star Wars game.  Disney should look to the model of BlizzCon as to how Star Wars should be given a boost.  StarCon, a three day convention of Star Wars fans and players; even having tournaments of high ends players (PVP, role playing).

I can see Obama contributed NOTHING...   Except for YOUR money.    \r\n Of course he is staying on the job making sure the government is working like it should.  Imagine what would happen if Obama was his normal self and did what he normally does, i.e. NOTHING.... \r\n I didn't realize his standard management was that POOR....

ABC reports Early voter results are Romney 52%       Obummer  46%  Hummmmmm............  ​ ..It is pretty close to the polls from Gallup and Rasmuessan Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Tuesday October 30, 2012 shows Mitt Romney attracting support from 49% of voters nationwide, while President Obama earns the vote from 47%. One percent (1%) prefers some other candidate, and two percent (2%) are undecided. This is the fourth consecutive day that Romney has been at the 50% level of support. He has enjoyed a three- or four-point edge on each of those days. No encumbent or challenger has ever lost the election having 50% or more in the polls going into the elections. \r\n  \r\nSwing state tracking: Romney 51% Obama 45% \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nNot Satisfied From Whiteliberals

Anytime an effort is made to fractionalize or divide the population, we need to question the motives collectively as a nation. We used to envy the 2 percenters and dream of achieving our own goal of richness. We used to resist taking what we feel was due us until we earned it, because we felt our turn would come. We trusted the intentions and need of those who accepted public assistance because they felt shame for being needy. We trusted the giving away of wealth by our federal government to buy friends that would rather despise us. We felt that our commitment to the success of our employer would actually mean something and a pension to boot. We toiled and did without because that was how we got rewarded in our old age. We were fools and still we hope.

ROMNEY MANY TIMES YOU HAVE GIVEN YOUR OPINION ABOUT "FEMA". YOU WANTS TO CUT THE MONEY FOR FEMA AS RYAN AND CANTOR DID A WHILE BACK! YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN A FORM OF FEMA WHEN YOU BECOME PRESIDENT, AND GIVE THE BUSINESS OF PROTECTING OF OUR CITIZENS IN THE EVENT OF STORMS, EARTHQUAKES, HURRICANES TO A PRIVATE AGENCY TO MAINTAIN THE ORDER AND RESCUE OPERATIONS OF OUR CITIZENS. WITH THIS MASSIVE STORM THAT HIT US SO HARD, A PRIVATE BUSINESS TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE HAD BEEN A JOKE. NO PRIVATE FIRM CAN MOBILIZE THOUSAND OF GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL AND FIRST RESPONDERS ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY WITH PRECISION, ENERGY, TRUST AND PERSEVERANCE, AND FAST RESCUE PROCEDURES THAN A WELL ORGANIZED GOVERNMENT AGENCY TO HELP OUR PEOPLE CAN DO ---SO ROMNEY LEARN A NEW LESSON, WE DO NOT WANT YOU BECAUSE YOU WILL GIVE THE SALVATION OF OUR PEOPLE TO A JUNKY AGENCY THAT WILL BE SLEEP DURING THE WHOLE DISASTER! YOUR AGENCY WILL BE A DUPLICATE OF BUSH FEMA, AND THAT WE WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS TIME. SO GO ON TO YOUR CAR ELEVATORS AND MONEY A LEAVE US ALONG. VOTE FOR OBAMA THE TRUE CARE PRESIDENT ON NOV 6, 2012

First we have flip flop Mitt who, if he was in the White House, would be taking care of his rich friends hurt by the storm first, then we can hold our breath while the rest of the world looks the other way and offers nothing to help with the burden of cleaning up the mess. Any aid for the victims of this storm will only be taken care of right here at home. I say the hell with our so called friends who are constantly holding their hands out for help from Uncle Sam.

HAHA.  I had a yard sale (I hate having them, I"m terrible at bargaining).  I had a free bin and I remember a lady coming up wanting to pay a few cents for something I could sell for a lot more (and did).  So then she raided my free bin and took about 5 charity calendars.  I was annoyed because she overdid it on the trying to get the price down and then who needs 5 calendars?  \r\nAnother time some older ladies pulled up in a Caddy and my friend was making jewelry and selling it at cost for charity while I did the garage sale for my used goods.  She even had a sign and was making the stuff there.  They wanted to pay her $.05 for something that cost her $5 to make.  Right after her a family pulled up in a rickety old van with 3 kids.  I was handing them stuff left and right.  They wanted to pay what the sign said and I could tell they needed help so I was doing buy one get one free and let the kids each pick something out from the toys.  \r\nWhoever holds these sales have a lot of patience.  I am not one of those people.  LOL

I really wish there were term limits. He is a reason why they are needed. You can't be elected over and over and over and expect things to get done with the same stupid ideas coming back year after year. I'm from Iowa and I really dislike him and what he stands for he pretends to be so Christian yet has no belief in his fellow man. But he judges people left and right and labels people and yet he proclaims to be such an upstanding Christian. Please Steve King who are you fooling? Unfortunately he fools a lot of those who vote for him in Iowa. I wish he'd be voted out already enough is enough!

where was GOD? is he helpless? If we are his children, why does he let this happen? Would you let this happen to your child and say, "oh well its free will"? No you would stop this at all costs. You are all fools!

The question was, “What do you think of Huckabee's ad?”  It is somewhat apparent Huckabee was addressing a specific and/or narrow group of individuals.  If that be true, he provided an advertisement adequate for his audience.  The man simply asked Christians to vote for the individual person they believe will stand closest to a biblical underpinning.   He too has the right to stand firm in his beliefs with the same freedoms as the rest of us.  Many enjoy the freedom to disagree with him as they have not known life without freedoms such as these.  Whether you approve of Obama or Romney, it is up to you and it is your freedom to vote for whomever you choose.  I personally do not care for either of the candidates and cannot speculate which is more or less viable.  I do know our country was founded on biblical principles, not the ethics these two candidates are portraying in public.

If this disaster had to happen I am glad for New Jersey and New York and all the other heavily hit areas, that it happened with President Obama in charge and not an Idiot that only cares about lining the pockets of his already rich supporters paying a low percentage of taxes (as they ship their tax savings to banks overseas) I saw him handing out supplies in Ohio (touching) Wonder what he was really thinking or what he will say tonight behind closed doors. Kudos to the President for not letting the states fend for themselves!!

I watched this show for about 10 minutes, mainly because Danielle is a cutie.  The main problem is it's clear she really, really doesn't want to be on TV (though apparently they agreed to do yet another reality show about people we don't know nor particularly care about).  She has no gift for presenting herself on screen - and yes it is something of a skill to be able to "turn on" when the cameras are on.  Like him or not Kevin is more the entertainer, has done (lame) Disney movies before so he kind of gets the basics of how to present yourself while the camera is on.  Danielle, on the other hand, is painful to watch outside of her obvious good looks.  This should be shelved immediately and I'm sure the ratings are low enough to pretty much guarantee it.

Being in the film industry since 1968, Hollywood is desperate for $$$$$$$$$$. Disney is about the only company left with any money to spend on buying out whoever! The digital age is now in full swing in the movie theaters. Prepare for the end of going to the movies as we know it. Theaters are in worse trouble than Hollywood! They put me out on the street after 25 years of nights, week-ends, and holidays. No thank you's, nothing! My reward was replacement by digital projection & un-employment at age 60. I hope Hollywood goes right down the toilet like TITANIC!

This is an excellent example of why there is no such things as ghosts.  Humans have been around on this planet for thousands of years.  Someone has almost certainly died in just about every spot.  Been buried everywhere and the bones turned to dust.  Ghosts would outnumber the living and would be EVERYWHERE.   \r\n  \r\nShe's right.  Whereever you believe the soul goes after death.  it's gone.  The bones SHOULD be tgreated with respect, though.  And reburied.

Yay!!! I voted this morning. Obama all the way. I walked magnificently with pride and conviction to cast my vote for the president. I am very happy I did.  I guess I am going to hell.  Well I will see you there Mike. God don't like dirty you know. You cannot intimidate me, deceive me or frighten me. I did not let the holier than thou party hold me down. I did not let the selective biblical doctrine hinder me.  What I do with my life  is between me and my God not between me and Huckabee or between me or the government. The bible, quran , Tanakh, etc all talked about peace, wars, eyes for an eye, care for the poor, neighbors keeper, lying, hatred, wickedness, killing, adultery, fornication etc. How you chose to interpret one or more of these depends how your race, religion, environment and political leaning allows you to. We all often  chose to point fingers at what we think is a sin while we blindly commit other sins of our own.

Mitt was born into Mormonism. He has been brainwashed from day one. There is very little chance of changing the mind of such a person. To turn his back on his religion would alienate him from his family. The Romneys are a big name in the Mormon church and he would be giving up that status as well. I grew up in the Mormon church and we had a Romney for a Bishop. In no way were they like Mitt other than being Mormons. Most Mormons I knew were nothing like Mitt Romney. I would not call him a fair representation of the church but I will say that those who had the most money or had a big name like Romney or Hinkley held the highest positions in the church.

Fish do reproduce themselves. The hacheries produce more fish "survivors" for sportsmen and women who pay for fishing licenses. Those funds support more than fish, but also birds and wildlife that habitat public and private lands. Everyone benefits, especially the mother and/or father who takes the kid fishing - family bonding - responsabilities learned - natural (steroid-free) food - etc.

She is probably upset because of what pressure she has to endure from him! The ironic thing is that it has been my experience as a former coach and athletic director that these types of parent fanatics NEVER PLAYED any organized sports! That girl will probably be the next Jimmy Piersal of Volleyball! A good friend of mine once said to a parent who came to him demanding more playing time, " ARE YOU FINISHED? THE NEXT TIME YOU COME TO ME TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING REGARDING THIS SPORT OR PLAYING TIME, YOU WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT YOUR SON'S PLAYING TIME BECAUSE HE WILL NO LONGER BE ON THE TEAM! HAVE A GOOD DAY". That was a great comeback in the late 70's, and the parents NEVER went to that coach again for fear that they would cause his dismissal from the team!

Hi. I am an Independant. If you think NPR is non-partisan,think again.They are in the tank for the Democrats just as much as Fox is in the tank for the Republicans. There is no such thing as non-partisan or non-biased,everyone has a bias. The hardest thing to find today is the truth,and it can mostly be found in these blogs where the common folks hang out.You have to sift through all the BS to find it though.There is some great comedic relief here too,I must say.

When you want something not to work or to progress then you call Obama. He did nothing in 4 Years that he said he would by his own words he Failed in reducing the debt, Failed in reducing unemployment, Failed in reducing  or making healthcare affordable to americans, Failed to pass immigration reform, Failed to improve economy. About  FEMA is just initials for a job that can be done by any state better than Federal Government. You do not need a bureaucrat far away from the storm site to give the state permission to name his state "disaster zone" like FEMA does at its own pace. The Governor of the State is the one closest to the disaster area and the one who can send help faster so it sounds good if FEMA gets reorganized and absorbed by the states. Not to mention that  states can eliminate waste of funds like they currently do.

Well, since I think it's wierd to go to the hospital to have a baby, and I had my babies in the comfort of my home, I would have hired a midwife and never even attempted to go to the hospital. Thanks Cindy, for proving that healthy babies don't NEED a damn doctor and overrated hospital staff to be born!!! Of course the doctors would disagree wouldn't they? and unfortunately no one will take that big truth away from this story.\r\n \r\nMoral, if you want to have nothing but issues with your labor and delivery, hire and OB/GYN and have your baby in a place where sick people flock...YIKES I feel bad for women for not knowing the truth :(

I will tell God that I didn't trust men to be able to curb their desire for power and sin. I will tell God that I am glad I never voted for Romney OR Obama. I will tell God that I'm GLAD I read the Bible and History and so know that whenever a religious person is trying to use religion to gain support for a secular Institution and (worse) it's not for God's glory but for Men. And then I will thank God for hearing me out giving me the capacity to see through the Ways of Men and realize that our race is easily decieved by even the nicest of us; and the nicest of us are just as easily decieved. Huckabee has quickly proved to be a person who prefers Politcal posturing to honest Faith. I wouldn't want to be in his shoes on the day of Judgment.

Obama will win. He is a politician just Romney is a politician however, the differences between the 2 is HUGE. Romney is a snake oils salesman whom will say whatever it takes to get in that Oval Office. Romney has no tact and I will rejoice when I see him give his consolation speech. He kind of reminds me of Meg Whitman, go ahead and keep on spending$$$$$$$ and keep on lying and at the end of the day he will lose just like she did. So for all you Obama haters, out there making it seem like Romney can walk on water and save jobs and the economy and etc. I cant wait to see you idiots on election night wondering what the hell went wrong.\r\n\r\nLet's Go Obama!!!!!!!!!!

I think Star Wars has the potential, like Lucas said, to live beyond himself. I really think it's a timeless story. I really didn't like Episode two or three, but the first four films were really good. If approached the correct way, these three movies can be really good. I don't think we should discount Disney. They did a wonderful job with The Avengers.

Irony is that Sandy will come to provide a stimulus to the economy from the private sector, as insurance companies use reserves to rebuilt infrastructure, and the public sector through FEMA helps the rebuilding and recovery. There is a perversity in distrasters enhancing the GDP.

Huckabee is exercising his rights of free speech, good for him.   America is going to hell in a hand-basket.  May be too far gone now to ever recover. All who follow Islam are not our enemies but there are enough fanatics among them that we(the civilized world) have a lot to worry about from that direction.  If China gets a wild hair and decides to call our loans due we are busted.  If the middle east gets an itch and decides that we (U.S.) get no more oil we are in a heap of trouble.  Our schools by and large don't teach, crimes are not punished, families are almost a thing of the past.  Disease, pollution, crime, indifference, greed, immorality, distrust, racial problems, are symptoms of a crippling and probably fatal illness that we have brought upon ourselves either by personal interaction or by putting people into office who are "supposed" to speak for us and whom, once they get into office,  then get into a  job of covering their own rears.    If our forefathers could see what "we" have done to this country I believe they would be greatly shocked and disappointed.  God CAN see what we have done to HIS world and each other and HE can't possibly be happy about it.  Just watch the news, lots of good things are happening but they seem to be greatly out numbered by the bad.  A man robbed of his wallet then shot to death, road rage causes death of innocent people, kids abused by adults, adults abused by kids with no recourse.  Bullying goes across all lines of age, sex, and physical make up, old against young, young against old.  Entertainment promotes violence, immorality, crime, and civil disobedience.\r\nPolice are helpless to prevent crime or protect the public.  They are great at explaining what happened after the fact.  That's just the way it is. I totally support law enforcement officers but they just can not be on the scene ahead of a crime in order to stop it from happening.  WE have to become better people in order to become a better nation and that change has to start at the top and the bottom and in the middle of our social strata and must be applied to our whole civilization.  Let me get off my stump, didn't mean to get long winded.

When you make an investment in future possibilities, you have to spend money.  Secondly, you will be fundamentally surprised to learn that this transaction will, in fact, rejuvenate the Star Wars franchise and make Disney a great deal of money.  Short sighted folks just want to milk the cow until it dies, by insisting on putting it all into dividends instead of investing in future growth paths.  This will prove to be a very smart move, and recognized as such, right after the first of the new series comes out.

It is surprising how successful Mr. Romney is at smoothing over his flip-flops.  He is a very capable market researcher, with a team that could sell ice to Eskimos.  Considering all his gaffs, terrible quotes, and complete changes in position on key issues, he should not even be a factor in this race, yet it is very close.  Politics at its best.  We are watching a virtuoso performance.

Listen, he served us well and brought joy to my childhood.  I am able to pass that down to my children and have the same enjoyment while watching my kids get excited at these films.  I am glad this will continue.  He's 68 and been through alot!  I dont blame him at all.  I thank Lucas for bringing his brilliant idea to light for all of us to enjoy!  For generations!!  As a father, I side with him.  He wants to do what he wants to do without anyone telling him different!  And with a price tag like this...he is passing it down to his children in both movies and wealth FOR YEARS!  His children will be able to do whatever they want to do, without strings.  Thank you George!

Donald is right in one way about this.Obama should be willing to immediately take him up on the offer but he is not going to be willing to do it.There is no way Obama would have spent 3 million dollars of his money to have all his records,including all his school records,passport records and birth certificate records sealed without a very good reason.Why is it that more people do not want to know more about the president?No one from his school years or any of his life history has ever came forward to divulge anything about Obama.Did no one know him before his political career? \r\nI find all of this very suspect,Why do you?

Michael Brown was more concerned with how he looked in a Nordstrom blue dress shirt at the time and as a Democrat working to insure the RE-election Obama/Biden, I think the former FEMA honcho as a lotta chutzpah to  take on the president.  He should go back and take care of his Arabian horses.

Wow MSN, way to take two separate sentences from two SEPARATE paragraphs, cut out everything in the middle, and paste it together into one sentence.  I thought 'The News' was supposed to be impartial... two thumbs up for journalistic integrity... NOT  \r\n What was really stated by King:\r\n \r\n First sentence... “I want to get them the resources that are necessary to lift them out of this water and this sand and the ashes and the death that’s over there in the east coast and especially the northeast,” King says. “But they need to come with a plan on how to spend it.” \r\n Second sentence... When Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in 2005, King voted to immediately send $10.5 billion to the disaster zone, but King balked at a second installment of nearly $52 billion for things like temporary trailer homes and preparing for future disasters. “Can you imagine in the middle of a disaster to ask for appropriations for mitigating future disasters?” King says. “That’s why I said no on that second round of appropriations for Katrina…because they spent it on Gucci bags and massage parlors and everything you can think of — in addition to what was necessary.” \r\n Let's not be naive, asking for 52 billion in additional funding to 'mitigate future disasters' was simply a 'cash grab' to catch politicians 'in the moment' by the legislature.  Ask yourself, if Kings comments as truly stated were so egregious, why does MSN go to the trouble of removing their true context?  The news media as a whole is politically biased and we must do our own diligence to get closer to the truth of what is being presented to us by these biased entities.

Your stat about gas prices is highly misleading. Average gas price under Obama never went as high as the $4.11 peak average under Bush. The reason the average gas price was artificially low when Obama took office is because we had entered a serious recession and the gas price reflected it. Check out a chart of average gas prices under both administrations and you may change your tune.

personal responsibility if the republicans want the black vote it is quite simple  elect a black republican to run for the president. what do you figure the odds of that is?  as for what obama did in his first two years in office as you should know that the senate needs not a 51 to 49 vote to pass healthcare law but 60 votes and it took 2 years of dealing to get it done thanks to the republican delay tactics. he also got pale grants for education done, also got bailout for the banks,  bail outs for the auto industry. I am sure you are quite aware of the statement made by the republican senate that the only thing we want to do is make obama a one term president. as for abe lincoln he could have only done what he did with the help of the house, senate and the thousands of blacks who joined the union army he certainly did not do it on his own. and  if it makes you feel any better even I would have voted for condaleeza rice if she wasever  to have run. she is a brilliante woman and I am white not black

I'm not sure what is wrong but my intire post didn't post as written. I am trying again so if it comes through twice, I'm sorry.\r\nThis is not an original for Mike Huckabee that he has put together. He is using the video that was put together by a Catholic based group (cc2w. org Catholics Called to Witness - 'Inspiring Catholics to Live Their Faith'). \r\nThe difference with the 2 videos is: the original is a visual video only with the music in the background and the one Mike Huckabee is promoting is with him talking throughout, explaining the things that are presented in the video. He has changed the wording to say Christian instead of Catholic. \r\nThis in and of itself is not a bad thing, it happens all the time when people like or agree with what someone else posts, they usually repost and may add their own touch to reach their own contact base.\r\nThis just goes to show that the Catholics and the Christians are united on the issues that are presented here in this video.

No,  Obama responded correctly .... \r\n \r\nI think "Brownie" has NO credibilty at all after his disasterous reponse to Katrina.\r\n \r\nI wonder what Romney will do now that this hurricane has devastated the most populace region of the USA ? ....... His latest stated public positon on FEMA was "to give it to  the states, and privatize it".  ...Really Mitt ? ..... I don't know any private enity that could deal with the magnitude of this disaster. \r\n \r\nRepublicans like to talk cutting goverment to the bone, but when something like this happens the Republican Emperors have NO clothes. \r\n \r\nWe are all in this together. I pray for all those affected by Sandy, here in California we are with you !

You may be a Christian? That is for GOD to Judge, but it is obvious that you have not studied THE TRUE WORD OF GOD (The Bible)! \r\nIn the past, Our Great Nation was blessed by GOD because we were founded on and maintained Biblical morals and values. This is no longer the case as this nation now promotes and allows the killing of innocent babies (as did Pharaoh of Egypt and King Herod who was attempting to kill The Christ Child) and embraces homosexuality (the very reason GOD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah). These two acts of mankind (abortion and homosexuality) are among the most DETESTABLE ABOMINATIONS AGAINST GOD! Anyone who believes that GOD will bless this nation while we allow these ABOMINATIONS AGAINST GOD to continue is simply ignorant of THE TRUE WORD OF GOD (The Bible).  \r\n“Christian” means = “CHRIST like”. JESUS CHRIST IS THE TRUE WORD OF GOD (The Bible)….. \r\nJOHN 1:14 “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.” \r\nPROVERBS 29:26 Many seek the ruler’s (political leaders) favour; But every man’s judgment cometh from the LORD. \r\nDEUTRONOMY 28:45 Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep His commandments and His statutes which He commanded thee: JAMES 4:4 Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world (politically correct) is the enemy of God. II JOHN verse 9 Whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. II JOHN verse 10 If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine (THE TRUE WORD OF GOD,The Bible), receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed: II JOHN verse 11 For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds. \r\nDid you hear THE TRUE WORD OF GOD? A True Christian will not even wish “God speed” to a politician who is in favor of abortion and homosexuality rights, let alone vote for that politician! Any self proclaimed Christian or anyone else who desires to be “a friend of the world” (politically correct) when it comes to abortion and homosexuality rights “is an enemy of GOD” and is not being Christ like (Christian) at all!  Anyone who votes for or supports in any way a politician who is against or opposes THE WORD OF GOD “in even one point” (this includes abortion and homosexuality), is a “partaker of ALL of his evil deeds” and in THE EYES OF GOD is “guilty” of performing every abortion and every homosexual act! \r\nJAMES 2:10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. \r\nAccording to THE TRUE WORD OF GOD WHO IS JESUS CHRIST: Mike Huckabee is RIGHT!

Yah, liberal is the problem we have with "lazy" teachers who don't do their jobs and want more government pay. Lazy public school teacher’s calls in sick allot and the aptitude of curriculums used and their teaching is [weak] terrible.  I say, if you want your children to have a good education, make the sacrifice; pay, and send them to a private school.  In the "private sector" where teachers are paid for excellent teaching performance; unlike Obumur who is going to be fired for 4 POOR years of performance ----Hey, that rhymes -  four poor years, four poor years, fire him, fire him, for four poor years; get that community organizer out of their before he creates a bigger disaster!

I feel that when you blow all your easy cash on partying, there should be no one feeling sorry for you. She was great as Joanie, but she should have listened and heeded all the advice that was given to her when she was playing that part. Tom Bosley/Mr.C gave them good advise throughout the years that Happy Days was televised. Old saying goes. "You made your bed, now sleep in it."

Donald can't help himself, he's just a generous guy.   \r\n Evidently the media's coverage on his offer wasn't getting the proper attention, so in an effort to bring the spotlight back on ...him,  he came up with this, most generous, consideration.   \r\n It's a shame he didn't think of using the opportunity to encourage people to donate to the hurricane relief efforts.   \r\n I guess he just got too tied up in being "The Donald".

Dear Iowans,\r\nHello from New York! I am enjoying a day at the office where I am very fortunate to have power. Most places here are dark and cold (like my home). It's bad and I hope you know that if it was bad there we'd want to see you get the help you needed. After all, we're all Americans (and human beings).\r\n\r\nIt would be a comfort to all of us in the recover areas if you Iowans gave this guy a good spanking on election day. Hopefully the lights will be back on by then and we can all celebrate together. \r\n\r\nThank you!

Kahlan123, I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt that you truly don't understand. I'm also guessing that younger readers might not get the reason for a guard on the Tomb, so this is for them as well.\r\n\r\nThe Tomb of the Unknown Soldier holds the remains of multiple service-people, who have died during the various wars that we have been involved in as a country. All of them are unidentified, or were when entombed, though not all unidentified soldiers end up in the Tomb. The Tomb exists primarily as a place of remembrance.\r\n\r\nThe guards, who are members of the 3rd Infantry Regiment, are there to protect the Tomb from desecration, defilement, and destruction; not from theft. They are tasked with assuring that ho harm comes to the Tomb or it's occupants, from any source. This may sound like a trivial thing, and as some have pointed out, a huge waste of money. However, these men and women sacrificed not only their lives, but their identities for the good of the rest of us; paying a few dollars to watch over their resting place is the least we can do.\r\n\r\nObviously, the guard is more symbolic than literal; If someone decided to bomb Arlington National Cemetery, I doubt the Old Guard would be able to do much. But these men and women of the 3rd Infantry would certainly stand their ground, bomb or no. Who are we to say they shouldn't?

This coming from the guy who was fired for mishandling Katrina relief efforts. I believe it was very smart to have everything in place before the storm hit. It wasn't about politics; it was about Americans in danger. I will give it to Obama for stopping everything else he was doing to ensure these people would get the help they needed.

your user name is quite correct pot calling the kettle black. you tell him that he picks and chooses what he wants from the bible yet you do exactly the same thing to make his belief seem wrong....bububububu look at these lines I will part and parcel out and take out of context of that part of the biblical story these are proof EVIL, wrong, Stupid...etc...etc\r\n\r\n Anyone blind enough to not see that america was founded on god and the bible...well that's just kind of sad.\r\n\r\nP.S: and yes slavery was a biblically accepted fact and fostered in the bible did that change? yes but one can easily go through the bible and see that slavery was only bad when it was gods chosen people that were enslaved and even then it was god itself that sent them into said slavery as punishment.... P.P.S: I don't agree with either of you but come on to even make the statement that america wasn't founded on god and biblical principals is just silly.

heh. How about the bar on Water Street in Eau Claire, Wisconsin that had a plumbing problem, so they called the plumber who found out they were not to code so would not do the work unless they paid the extra to get to code. So, the bar owner cut off the pipes from the urinals into the basement, and drained the urinals into 55 gallon barrels. A few times a night, he had employees carry the barrels up the steps and dump them in the alley behind the bar. This went on for like 6 months before they were caught and closed down for a couple weeks until everything was fixed.

I read voraciously, but I don't just accept everything that agrees with what I want to believe.  This event may or may not have anything to do with AGW - it is consistent with AGW - and scientists say it will happen more frequently.\r\n\r\nBut whether this event is tied to AGW is irrelevant to whether AGW is actual science.\r\n\r\nHowever, I doubt your claim.  There were storms in the 50s - and the intensity may have been greater and it may have affected more people, but larger in extent?  \r\n\r\nHurricane Able, for example, was a much strong storm.  It took 11 lives and did about $1 million in damage (eqv may $10 million today ... just guessing on that).  And that was before we had our early warning systems.

I don't think we can say with any certainty that this woman was trying to start a race war.  We really don't know her motive.  I knew people who have harmed themselves in an attempt to blunt emotional pain or even because they felt so numb, and to cover what they had done they would sometimes invent a story that someone had attacked them.  One lady cut her own throat and injured herself worse than she intended-and to cover what she had done because she was ashamed she broke a window and told the medics that someone had broken into her home and assaulted her.  EMT's and doctors do not always treat people well if they know the person harmed themselves on purpose-sometimes they willl sew up a cut without anesthesia or something like that, I suppose they think the pain will "teach" the patient not to do it again.  However, all it does is add more shame and traumatize the person; and the person has even MORE emotional pain that may lead them to self-harm even worse the next time.\r\n \r\nOf course, I have no idea if any of this applies to this woman at all.  There have been cases of women who have set themselves on fire for this reason, though.  If she is mentally ill, she does not deserve our contempt.  People don't become mentally ill on purpose.  If she meant this to start a race war or something like that, then she is badly mixed up and confused.  Whatever the case, I am willing to offer my prayers for her.

They should have been adopted out when they were babies, now they are a wreck.  Even if they were given to loving families today they need so such therapy.

Sadly these kids seemed destined to be depressed adults with serious addiction issues like their mother.

It is so hard for Huckabee to realize he is of no consequence to anyone but ultra rightwing nutjobs. The BHRR's (blackhearted racist republicans) are headed for a fall.

Not true.  That may be your honest perception, but that is not the truth.  Almost everything I post is from NOAA, NASA, National Academies, EPA, and so forth.   At a stretch, I will post from sciencedirect or phys.org or some such.  I don't recall ever posting anything to this forum from HP or MM, though I have infrequently posted their links in other fora.   I suspect I post links from HP or MM with about the same frequency I post links from Fox.  The central problem is that you guys keep bringing up innuendo and assertions, but never any actual firsthand citations.  \r\n\r\nYou have made up your mind before you know anything about it - and have set a bar so high for accepting real science that no science could achieve it, IF YOU APPLIED THE SAME STANDARD CONSISTENTLY, while at the same time, you have set a very, VERY low bar for what you are willing to accept if it agrees with what you want to believe.  This is understandable.  You have been and are being manipulated.  Of course you don't perceive it that way.  If you perceived it, you wouldn't be so easy to manipulate.\r\n\r\nI note you got two thumbs up for this message.  I'm guessing one is from yourself, but at least 1 had to come from someone who presumably agrees that I post from HP and MM.  It's really incredible.  You guys just make stuff up.

This whole thing is driving me crazy.  It seems that many of my Christian friends are having to play psychological games with themselves, convincing themselves that Romney believes exactly the same as they do (no offense to Mormons, but their beliefs are quite different from those of traditional Christianity-I've looked into it), so that they will feel more comfortable voting for him.  That seems kind of bizarre to me.  Furthermore, many of them are so focused on the issues of abortion and gay marriage that it is as if nothing else exists-as if the BIble never mentioned caring for the poor or any other issue, when it actually talks about helping the poor repeatedly.  The Bible even specifically talks about the GOVERNMENT helping the poor.  \r\n \r\nI don't see why someone can't just vote for the person whose platform lines up closest to what they believe and what is most important to them without having to play all these strange games-and for me the person would not have to share the same religious beliefs I have as long as I felt I could trust them.  Jesus picked disciples from all ends of the political spectrum-one was a Zealot, part of a group who hated Rome so much they wanted to overthrow the government by military force and another was a tax collector, who collaborated directly with Rome and was able to cheat his fellow Jews and benefit financially while doing it.  Imagine their first meeting!  \r\n \r\nIf Jesus thought both those men from two political extremes worthy to be his disciples then how can anyone today say that someone will be condemned to hell for their party affiliation?  (Though I'm pretty sure Matthew was expected to stop cheating people...)   Jesus refused to become political, though he did correct people if they were wrong about something.  He even healed the servant of a Roman soldier.

When did hard working Americans become the enemy? I never expected to have millions. Just what my parents and others had when I was growing up. A job, a home and food on the table and a good reliable car. Maybe a little green in a can for when I'm gone for my children. Now those who have more than they can count, strongly feel, we are those weeds growing in your nice green lawn. King is just like all of these greedy, uncaring politicians who strongly feel, I've got mind, I will keep it even if there are folks who will starve, loose your homes, so what. If there were those who purchased Gucci bags, don't prevent the people that this just happened suffer. Shame on these heartless non humans!

I'm with Romney/Ryan on this.  Disaster relief should not be the responsibility of government.  Most of these folks didn't even have hurricane and flood insurance so why should we taxpayers pick up the tab for their irresponsibility.  Also, all of those businesses hit by the storm were built by self-starters without help from government or others.  If "They Built It" they can surely Rebuild It too!  And also rebuild the roads and the subways, piers, beaches, houses, bridges, etc. without the unwanted interference of Obama and his socialist government.

JOAN RIVERS AND THE FASHION POLICE  ... This one totally escapes my ability to comprehend the value here.  It's one thing to diss about the clothing on some of the stars but when it's also as vulgar and viscious to say that someone's clothing is as ugly as their vagina????  Ok... connect the dots for me... I'm missing something here.  Her little panel wouldn't dare go against her so they roll their eyes and exclaim, "Joan!"  Kelly Osbourne's purple hair... and the rest of her puppets  all have little to be condeming others for.  This for me is sanctioned bullying. So... in agreement with the signs that she and her daughter were holding to spread the word about bullying.... 'MAKE IT STOP".    Kind of an oxymoron that she is a spokesperson for anti-bullying considering she is the biggest bully of them all.\r\n \r\nI could go on and on about the quality of programming but I'll let it REST IN PEACE.

"The right to life from conception to natural death".  So Huckabee says a vote for Romney is a vote to abolish the death penalty and open the door to stricter gun control?  As far as I know he's the first GOP candidate to follow the pro-life stance past birth in a consistent way.  Good for him.

This guy is the ost discusting puke in our country.  When I worked in Chicago, his building there was known as the "TRUMP-DUMP".  You have to wonder how this puke made his money considering that I have never met or talked to anyone who thought he was worth a SH*T or had anything remotely valueble to say.  He has crewed thousands with his failed RE deals, been sued several hundred times just in the recent past and has made an **** out of himself countless times all because he feels as if he is someone "special" because he has money.  How did this puke get started?  He didn't do it himself; he got his money from "daddy" who from all indications was a decent guy who was a partner in the Levittown deals back after WW2.  Most people would lovbe to see "The Donald" evaporate.

I can't believe the way people are posting on this board.  If you believe in Romney and what he says one day and changes the next day, go ahead and vote for him.  My opinion is that if you think Sandy and Katrina were disasterous, then wait - if Romney/Ryan get into office, it will seem like the end is coming for the 47%.  All that women and gay people who fought for their rights as free citizens of the US with the same rights and privileges will no longer have those rights.  Nonprofits who work for all types of people and their issues will no longer receive support for their endeavors from the government - what do you think Romney meant when the idiot said he would fire big bird.   I could go on and on, but those who have not looked closely at what Mitsey and his elf Ryan believe in, are going to be in for a rude awakening.  I hope Hillary runs in the next go-round and I would like to see Caroline Kennedy as her running mate, but that will not happen if the US continues to be so anti-women.

very interesting, make sure no one says anything negative about barrack Hussein obama (could hardly get the spelling correct) such an american name.  donald trump is right.  he offered a 5 million dollars donation to the pres favorite charity to release his original birth certificate & his college dtranscript.\r\nyou dems are worrying about fema or your freebees?  get real.  we need real change.  4 years is long enough.  another 4 years & you won't have to worry about fema cause there won't be in $ there for anything.  believe it.  our country is in worse shape under the pres than during the great depression.

The governor has a right to his recommendations, but I would think the individual city mayors/city councils are intelligent enough to decide what's best for the safety of their town.  Afterall, Halloween is not a State or Federal holiday nor are local festivities subsidized by Federal or State funds.

I love all those shows too.  'Mike and Molly' is awesome and frickin' hilarious.  I am so glad the viewers got over the fact that two large people are going to be kissing and shown in bed together a lot.  I used to really like 'How I Met Your Mother' but they have "jumped the shark" already so it's time for the show to end along with 'Two and a Half Men'.  I loved that show when Charlie Sheen was on.  He was the show so without him, it just isn't the same.

All Reality shows need to get AXED, except for shows that are actually doing something beneficial, i.e. Pit Bulls and Parolees (Show about saving Pit Bulls and finding homes for them), Gator Boys (Show about capturing gators in Florida and prevent them from being killed, etc. \r\n  \r\nNon beneficial, i.e. Keeping up with the Kardashians, Jersey Shore (which thankfully was cancelled), etc.

Scariest place..Hmmm. I'm not sure. My house has been something horrible sometimes...A lot of apparitions have been seen there and a lot of experiences have been had there...I think the two that stuck out to me the most was when I was up one night when I was 15...A few years ago...I heard a knock on my door cause I had it shut because I was up at 2 AM on the computer..And whispering came from outside. I thought it was my dad, telling me to go to sleep like always. I said "Yeah, Ok! I will." And then I heard it again..This time it sounded like it came from inside of the room, I ignored it...And then it whispered again, this time closer--I ignored it again..And then again, even closer...Once again I just brushed it off as my imagination..And then this time, it sounded like it was whispering RIGHT into my ear, but I couldn't make out what it was saying and all of a sudden I heard a loud long sigh in my ear and my HAIR gets picked up and TUCKED behind my ear. I have never ran out of my room as fast as I did that night...

@Reeftyg..\r\nYou may be taking Obama's statement out of context too.  'clinging to their bibles and guns'  imo, is a statement that could describe people who are so rigid in their own interpretation that they have no room to accept a different one.. even a different \r\n'christian' one.. Let's face it.. Christians fight amongst themselves over biblical quotes.. so I don't think his statement is offensive.  I think he was spot on..

This about former GWB croney:\r\n \r\nOn August 31, 2005, following Hurricance Katrina being named an "Incident of National Significance", Brown was named the Principal Federal Official and placed in charge of the federal government's response by Homeland Security Director. On September 7, 2005, then Coast Guard  Chief of Staff Vice Admiral Thad Allen  was named Brown's deputy and given operational control of search and rescue and recovery efforts.\r\nOn September 9, 2005, Chertoff relieved Brown of all on-site relief duties along the Gulf Coast, officially replacing him with then Vice Admiral Allen. Brown remained Under Secretary of Emergency Preparedness and Response. Brown told the Associated Press that "the press" was making him a scapegoat for the slow federal response to the hurricane.\r\nOn September 12, 2005, Brown announced his resignation as director of FEMA. He commented that the negative publicity surrounding him was distracting attention from the relief effort.\r\nChertoff granted Brown two 30-day contract extensions in order not to "sacrifice the real ability to get a full picture of Mike's experiences." Brown continued to receive his $148,000 annual salary until November 2, 2005, when he left in the middle of the second 30-day extension.

That is what he was before the new movies. Traditional star wars lore had Vader as the dreaded slayer of Jedi. In the new movies, the only Jedi vader killed were younglings. He bushwacked Mace windu, and got his butt kicked when he fought Obi Won. Not a legendary villian, but a chump! \r\n  \r\nHe also turned to the dark side too easily. The emperor told him, "Server me!". Anikan replied, "Uh...OK". That was all it took to turn him. Very lame George, very lame.

Just one nailed the typical South Dakotan attitude about politics. \r\n \r\nOnce a politician starts to do things we don't agree with, we get rid of them. Since the majority of South Dakotans are conservative by nature (notice I did not say Republican or Democrat) we tend to take a dim view of out of control budgets and intruding on our personal liberties. We also want someone that understands South Dakota values and not the values formed by working overseas for foreign companies. \r\n \r\nHad Varilek obtained his degrees then come right back to South Dkota to build his future in a local company, we probably wouldn't be talking about this and he'd probably be doing better in the polls.

Some may think that Sandy was a Biblical storm. I think the Bible is still alive and well and won't make a decision as I've been in the military during war and then a firefighter for 30 years. Satan is a clever liar and destruction is his game. I am suspicious of obama as once a muslim, always a muslim. A muslim can lie to a 'non believer' w/o consequence. Obama's 4 years, as he put the Benghazi muslim murders, has not been optimal. Just like Nero who fiddled and sang as Rome burned, obama let our martyrs die and went to Vegas. He should be tried for manslaughter and/or impeached. God lives.

Option two: If climate change is real and we go your route and do nothing to address it, the byproduct is disaster, death and famine.

Chris Christie will hopefully make a good future President. He's like the Republican Obama in that he is about as straight shooting as you are going to get from a politician. He's man enough to throw politics aside and praise Obama for his handling of the hurricane like a human being rather than lie to try to help his party! It's disgusting how rare that is in politics today. He holds town hall meetings and lets hostile question-askers at him. He's not fake and from everything I've seen from his handling of this storm and his decision to postpone Halloween he seems to be a caring guy.

Or be condemned if the religious principles apply, and even from the 'greatest good of the greatest number' standpoint of Bentham, MIll and others. Whether existential, material or ecclesiastical, the truth is, to let someone drown is indeed tantamount to murder.    \r\nAnd dont worry.  I am sure Thinker would actually lend a hand...after a while. \r\n Money,\r\n LOL,...I don't know CL.personally, so I don't know if her words over these months truly represent  the person she is, I might save her, but it would be at the moment of her last breath......who knows though, I might deem letting her go would improve the planet.....and let her philosophy of survival of the fittest play out..

Lucas sold out only because the fans really let him have it as far as the remakes of the Originals and the way he did the Prequels.  He basically realized how bad he screwed up.  So now he's doing here what he should have done for the prequels - hand the reigns over to a new generation of filmmakers.  He directed A New Hope, which is very understandable; but he let someone else direct The Empire Strikes Back, which is STILL considered the best of the whole saga thus far.  The story as a whole is his baby, no one can take that away from him.  However for the prequels, he should've just laid out the whole framework of how he wanted to story to play out, get a very capable screenwriter to write the scripts, and get an experienced director to direct; and of course leave Jar Jar as an abandoned concept.  With that formula, the fans would've gotten a more comprehensive story with much better acting, and I guarantee you we wouldn't be talking about this 2day.

same as all the others.  Hes a politician. \r\nAlthough not exactly the same, when i was in the army i had an idea of the leaders who were in charge of us.  that they would make what we considered good decisions.  We thought we knew how they reacted as they had come and talked to us and impressed us with their expertise.  \r\nCourse i ended up getting hey youd to guard a division tactical operations center.  We had three brigade commanders, one division general and the general of the whole area had showed up and was watching.  The division general asked about the battle plan. two ways to attack the enemy.  One way would have 85% casualties with 80% success rate. the other way would have 20% casualties with about a 40% success rate.  the division general told the brigade commander to go the first way, even though there would probably be 85% casualties.  He turned away then turned back and said, and Bob call the replacement depot so you can get refilled.  \r\nPolitics is politics.

The problem is real, the oceans are changing, its temperatures are rising, fish and reefs are dying as a result, and we have the GOP and the Faithful sticking their heads in the sand, denying that humanity has any causal effect. \r\nWhy?   Is it money, contributions by dirty industries, For the GOP, Clean energy is a dirty word.  \r\nWe see the GOP proposing the same failed theories over and over, whether Romney hawking the very same Bush II policies which created our meltdown, and the GOP politicians denying the cause, and effects of global warming. \r\n\r\nWhy do people vote for individuals who have no solutions to our, and the worlds problems?  Is redistributing more wealth to the top 2% at the expense of the 98% a solution? .  The Faithful love to call Democrats Socialists.  Yet the true "Socialists" are the GOP, which over the past GOP Administrations has managed to redistribute over 36% of America's wealth to their most favorored "Job Creators", while during their Administrations, created only half as many jobs as the alleged "Socialist Democrats". \r\n\r\nSo, what has the GOP and Romney's economic plan done for America other than redistributed massive amounts of wealth to the top 2%, and create the Bush II economic meltdown?   Do you really want let Romney/Ryan do it all over again? No solutions, no answers, just the same failed economic theories. It took Bush and the GOP 8 years to create this mess, and our impatient nation expects Obama to fix it in 4 years, when the past 2 have been nothing but block ande stall any programs designed to rebuild our economy, choosing instead, to "Make Obama a one term President", maliciously hoping a suffering nation and people the GOP deliberately chose to keep suffering, would vote Obama out.\r\n\r\nIt is all about winning for the GOP, not nation, or its people..

I haven't watched three and a half men since Charlie Sheen left. Frankly I don't like his replacement and I knew it wouldn't be funny anymore. And reality shows. Thats all we have plus stupid, really stupid comedy shows. I loved shows like Perry Mason, mystery shows. I love NCIS, NCIS NY & LA.

@TabbyK.  How can you claim that a person's religion is irrelavent?\r\n \r\nIf their actual beliefs are consistent with their stated religion, it is one of their defining characteristics on social issues.  It defines their underlying belief structure which defines their personal moral code which will guide their decisions.\r\n \r\nIn practice, I do not believe anything politicians say about matters of faith because it is quite often for show.  However for Romney, I suspect that it is largely genuine, because if it was all show, the last faith he would pick would be Mormonism.

A candidate's religion is NOT Irrelevant . It is actually one of the most important things to consider when placing your vote.  This president will likely be appointing 1-3 justices on the Supreme Court during his term. Justices are there for life not just 4-8 years , and they are the moral and legal "gods" of our nation. It doesn't matter whether you are left or right in your political philosophy, religion should be of MAIN concern when voting next week.

Definitely these later repo shows that are filmed with very PHONY setups like the one with the Big guy, his sister and her ex and the body building Idiot. And then there is the one from down South with his wife and buddy that are just as Ignorant! Some of the first REAL repossession shows that came out first years ago WERE REAL and PRETTY DAMN GOOD! One specific show was made up of a salt and pepper team that did it up in Jersey, Now those guys were REALLY doing repos with NO PHONY FIGHTS, these guys are just some of the real people that go out and risk their lives to repo vehicles!!!

None of these jobs really appeal to me. However, any of them would be better than going on welfare and sucking off the government tit and complaining about your bad luck. I think the point of this article is to show that there are options for people who didn't save enough for retirement, instead of becoming a burden on family or society.

"Halloween history crosses over with the Gaelic tradition of Samhain (pronounced SOW-in)." Really? "Crosses over"? How about co-opted. \r\nHalloween was taken over by the Christian conquerors of the time and altered to All Hallows Eve. The original concept of Samhain being the day when the veil was thinnest, between our world and the realm of Faerie ... so that mortals could wander into Faerie and faeiries (elves, pixies, goblins, etc.) could wander into our world ... got changed to a night when the spirits, the dead and other evils things would walk and thank goodness we had this new religion and its saints to protect us. \r\nIt's not any different than the co-opting of local and regional religious traditions for holidays like Easter and Christmas.

Appearing on the networks this morning, Christie, for the third day in a row, heaped praise on Obama’s handling of the storm. “The President has been outstanding in this,” he told the “Today” show. On “Morning Joe,” he said, “It’s been very good working with the President. He and his Administration have been coördinating with us. It’s been wonderful.” Speaking on CNN, Christie said that he had been mightily impressed by Obama’s accessibility throughout the crisis. “He gave me his number at the White House, told me to call him if I needed anything, and he absolutely means it.” Christie also pointed out that Obama didn’t once bring up politics in their conversations, and added, “If he’s not bringing it up, you can be sure that people in New Jersey are not worried about that, primarily if one of the guys running isn’t." \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThank God for Romney's support of FEMA ROTFLMAOAYFOOLS.

There's a lot more to the story here.\r\nI was spending 2 hours a night at the gym & that isn't an option if you're a supportive husband & a father (my wifes guilt-trips finally wore me down).  Unless these bodybuilders have incredibly supportive partners, they're likely to be single because these "gym rats" have too be so focused on themselves, that they can't be supportive of their partners.  Most of us, including myself, will not make the sacrifices that so many of these male & female bodybuilders are often forced to make; I'm not willing to endure that kind of lonliness.\r\nThe only thing "grotesque" about these bodybuilders are the conditions that they are forced to display themselves.  While training; they eat healthy, consume a lot of water, a lot of protein & an assortment of supplements.  Things become "grotesque" when they dehydrate themselves to achieve the high muscle definition & then they lather up with all that baby oil & orange crap.  A lot of these guys appear to be in perfect physical shape, but their organs have suffered at the expense of building all that muscle; too much protein is hard on the liver & kidneys.  \r\nWhen these guys are training is when you see them at their best, doing what they love.  These competitions give bodybuilding a bad image to something that is truly great if done right. People, especially law makers, need to educate themselves about the effects of steroids before they judge others.

A glob of goo is not a baby. It is not wrong for two of the same sex to marry. It is wrong to marry, PERIOD. It is ownership, plain and simple. It is not wrong to hold the government accountable for money (especially the 500 million that went missing during the Iraq war). It is not wrong to have morals but forcing your religious beliefs on others is wrong. "God" is a myth created by narcissistic men to control or belittle others. You can hear the narcissism in the bible; I am a jealous God, blah blah blah. Doesn't sound like a God to me at all. Sounds like a narcissistic jerk. Hope this helps. Sincerely, Marinmom1- a logical human being.

Which is neither one~ Insanity - doing the same thing over and over but expecting different results~ Albert EInstein \r\nAnd main problem is people have been given so many half truths by false and weak leaders from either side they wouldnt know the real truth if it were stamped on their foreheads~ So what we have is not a Republic not a Democracy although, Americans hear that word often~ American people have an oligarchy ruled by a handful or so of elite bankers controlled through Wallstreet which is controlled by British Empire; through big banks of London~ Article 4 section 4 The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion [such s that of communism socialism democracy oligarchy]; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence.  \r\n"Hence it is that such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths." James Madison \r\nSo premoting Democracy even though what Americans really have is an oligarchy is both dyslexic and inept~ \r\nLast there is not even supposed to be a two party system~ So true Christians will stay home and pray and not vote for insanity because only people in their right minds know this truth which there are some and enough to infest the thought of such into others~ Solution: A true patriot will go against the grain to gain and not go along to get along like Peter Pan or Tinker Bell~ And this is exactly what I am doing through the military~ Elites put of the two faces in front not We The People~ So voting for either is just voting for the same of what all already have~ And that is insane~ Something will give watch~! Petty issues mean nothing in accordance to an overall sham and power hungry leaders who dont have solutions to offer only problems~ As part of the Divide and Conquer method American people are being lead down a road of destruction no matter who it is in office~ Because the faces in the front may change but the true agenda and oligarchy dont unless, the American people make it happen~ I am voting for Albert E. So if you vote wear the spiritual mark and wear it well~ Because I dont force people to be saved~ If they dont care to be they WON'T~ Antonius Shad AKA The Light

"How about an article about revamping our retirement strategies?"\r\n \r\n Based on your comments, you only appear interested in options that don't require you to put out any money, or in strategies that promise bigger returns with no risk.  The former are dying out, and the latter don't exist.   \r\n Put on your big boy pants, quit blaming others, and and take some responsibility.

Joe, I never said anything like that.  I think you are just repeating a scripted, political response about science you don't understand.  But that's okay. The EPA and NOAA understand the actual science better than you and me.  The problem isn't with the natural cycle of Ozone creation and depletion, but the unnatural forcing effect imposed upon it.  From the EPA site:\r\n"The CFCs are so stable that only breaks them down. When that happens, the CFC molecule releases atomic chlorine. One chlorine atom can destroy over 100,000 ozone molecules. THE NET EFFECT IS TO DESTROY OZONE FASTER THAN IT IS NATURALLY CREATED." [Emphasis mine]

Under Romney rule he would ask for donations when natural disasters like this happen.\r\nThe price tag for Sandy $50 billion and rising.\r\nThat is a lot of canned food Mr. Romney.\r\nMaybe if your followers would take out their check book instead and adding some big zeros behind it your plan would work.\r\nSo all you backers of Romney here is your chance to prove me wrong.\r\nGet your check books out and make that donation large. Very Large.

yes BROWNIE IS CORRECT- the president responded too quickly.  he is trying to compensate for his administration's lack of response in libya and trying desperately to overcome what some feel was a lack of quick response during hurricane katrina.  i lived through that storm and can say with all honesty that the administration at the time did everything possible to help it's citizens.  the idiots in new orleans who didn't evacuate have ony themselves to blame for their horror.  PEOPLE - SEE OBAMA'S ACTIONS FOR WHAT THEY ARE.  HE'S TRYING EVERY WAY HE CAN TO KEEP HIS JOB!!!!  HE DOESN'T HAVE A SINCERE OR COMPASSIONATE BONE IN HIS BODY.

you honestly believe that christians have in no way caused any of the perceived backlash against them?  they're attempting to change the fundamental tenets of this country through subversion, historical revisionism, and by pushing for leaders who are willing to require others to live by the same arbitrary and inconsistent moral code they claim to have.  and maybe... just maybe that's why people have begun to push back against them.

For the most part i agree with you, but Romney believes in magic underwear and that he will get his own planet when he dies.  I'm believe all religions are rediculous and ignorant, but Mormonism is a special kind of crazy, right up there with Scientology.

ROMNEY, MANY TIMES YOU HAVE GIVEN YOUR STUPID OPINION ABOUT "FEMA". YOU WANTS TO CUT THE MONEY FOR FEMA AS RYAN AND CANTOR DID A WHILE BACK! YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN A FORM OF PRIVATZED FEMA WHEN YOU BECOME PRESIDENT, AND GIVE THE BUSINESS OF PROTECTING OF OUR CITIZENS IN THE EVENT OF STORMS, EARTHQUAKES, HURRICANES TO A JUNKY PRIVATE AGENCY TO MAINTAIN THE ORDER AND RESCUE OPERATIONS OF OUR CITIZENS. WITH THIS MASSIVE STORM THAT HIT US SO HARD, A PRIVATE BUSINESS TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE HAD BEEN A JOKE. NO PRIVATE FIRM CAN MOBILIZE THOUSAND OF GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL AND FIRST RESPONDERS ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY WITH PRECISION, ENERGY, TRUST AND PERSEVERANCE, AND FAST RESCUE PROCEDURES THAN A WELL ORGANIZED GOVERNMENT AGENCY TO HELP OUR PEOPLE CAN DO ---SO ROMNEY YOU ARE  SICK IN THE HEAD, LEARN A NEW LESSON, WE DO NOT WANT YOU BECAUSE YOU WILL GIVE THE SALVATION OF OUR PEOPLE TO A JUNKY AGENCY THAT WILL BE SLEEP DURING THE WHOLE DISASTER! YOUR AGENCY WILL BE A DUPLICATE OF BUSH FEMA, AND THAT WE WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS TIME. SO GO ON TO YOUR CAR ELEVATORS AND MONEY AND LEAVE US ALONG. VOTE FOR OBAMA THE TRUE CARE PRESIDENT ON NOV 6, 2012

Two things... FIRST: most mature women know that the composite of birth control pills eases the hormonal imbalances of menopause. Youth discovers that the birth control pill stabilizes hormonal imbalances from genetic issues. SECOND: To the poster who had the heart attack-- first, healthcare costs are higher NOW because of the higher cost of administration. Hospitals are consolidating but administrative pay is on the order of hired-in CEOs. The whole idea behind the new Healthcare Act is stabilizing ALL costs. Like most things turned political right now, Republicans who benefit from our current structure OPPOSE change. We have no choice. Change that benefits everyone is good overall. I too am self-employed. I'd be more concerned about smaller packages, lesser supply or premium-priced supply. I'd worry about achieving shifts to alternatives so we can continue to afford living in America. The GOP are NOT our rulers, they just think they are.

all you christian huckabee followers out there Mr huckabee is not asking you to follow what is written in the bible he is asking you to accept the book of mormon to replace the bible. the bible says there will be false prophets does a man who claims he recieved gold tablets from jesus claiming the mormons would be the only followers who asend to heaven ring a bell. no one other than joseph smith has ever seen these gold tablets and Romney is one of his followers. so if you christians wish to follow false prophet's i suggest you take mr huckabee's advise  and follow him put down your bibles and pick up the book of mormon as romney, ryan, atkin, mourdock, limbaugh have

just because you are homeless does not mean you can harrass people for money or anything else for that matter. don't approach people agressively and expect them not to defend themselves! and the only reason he told the cops Hackman beat him up is probably because he knew who he (Hackman) was and he was trying to make a quick buck!

Anything that promotes itself as a reality show should be axed. Please also include anything that includes "Girls" or "Guys" in the title. I cannot stand the Housewives of Beverly Hills. Since when are they housewives??? One brags how seldom she has sex with her husband, two are certifiable and are sisters, and the rest are girls that have a lot of time on their hands. Now I know why Camille Grammer is crazy, she was married to a nutcase and it must have rubbed off on her, or she was tht way to begin with and that is why he liked her. I think we will watch as his next marriage unravels soon as well, unless she is a whacko too. It is amazing to me that all of these women have so much money and manage to look so cheap. Just proves that you can be wealthy without having any class, brains or maturity. PLEASE cancel them!

Hope those writing here to say they like the quick response from Obama, even though they're not going to vote for him, are ready to kiss FEMA goodby if their candidate should fool enough people to win.  I guess if they don't live in a state threatened by any kind of natural disaster, they don't care that their emergency service will be handled by Hallaburton or the Koch brothers.  Or maybe Mitt can hold another "relief drive" and load up a truck full of donated canned goods for the Red Cross to hand out.

My father was a Ford union worker for 35 years who voted as a Democrat until Jimmy Carter...He finally realized Democrats took union money from the workers to stay in power and never lifted a finger to help them against foreign competitors playing by different rules...Democrats did the same thing to the garment industry and the steel industry... Democrats have been leeches on the *a$$ of every working man in America...and only discovered the middle class recently as they had been their traditional milk cow for the lower income classes they created programs for in exchange for their votes....

I love Ghost stories, but this one makes me laugh. It's about as genuine as a Kardashian "leaked" sex video.  Whenever I watch one of these, I feel like I'm wathcing their audition tapes for a new upcoming scary movie, because they will read scripts of both.  If anyone believes these "Ghost" stories are not written for their hollywood guests, then this show would actually be a lot of fun to watch, I just can't suspend my disbelief that much anymore. \r\n \r\n "Now read that line again with more awe and fear..."  LOL

The people that are shallow enough to listen to Huckabee are already going to vote as he wants.  His man murdered over a millon people and destroyed our economy. Now he wants another one to finish the job and kill another million just because Huckabee doesn't understand the truth of life. Abortions and homosexuals are just a small part of our problems.. Is Huckabee one of those 'extraordinary people'? When God created man we were designed so that if we have sex at a particular time of the month a pregnancy may occurr. That design is all God has to do with most pregnancies. A pregnancy is not God desiring to create another human (he has been tired of us for a long time). It is a natural occurance precipitated by mans actions. All are born into sin why would we he want more sinners to abuse one another and this earth? He can con some of them out of 10%. Ignorant phony.

@justmeMaggie2468 \r\nThere's no need for profanity and insults- they accomplish absolutely nothing...We all hate the Donald but even you would agree that if president Obama had nothing to hide, he would release the documentation and make some charity infinitely happy (not to mention the benefiaciaries- maybe Sandy's victims) by donating the 5 million. It's a little sacrifice for a very worthy cause. \r\n \r\nThat would force Trump to put his money where his big mouth and hair are. Think about it!!

Two of the best shows on TV are an American Horror Story and Southland..Amazing acting and great quality of production..

Donald Trump is the reason for birth control.  I would be willing to bet that he paid the women who have been with him to not only marry him, but also birth his extra UGLY children.  You would think that with all of his money he could have paid for face lifts for his offspring.  He should punch his own ticket out.  That would be good T.V.

After the Democrat Mayor of New Orleans left the buses parked and his people in harms way I guess all Democrat run Governments need Fema because they can't wipe there own a--'s. Everyone blamed Bush but when an emergency happens who's there ? Not someone in Washington. The Governor and the person in charge of the City or town call the shots. The first responders are local, Police, Fire, National Gaurd, Red Cross ect. are all Local. \r\n       Look at NY , NJ, VA, DEL,  there Governor's reacted, there local Mayors reacted, they didn't leave there people in harms way. I believe the Democrats in LA. neglected there own people to make Bush and Fema look as bad as possible . Especialy New Orleans heck it dosen't take anyone with a half a brain to know those people were in danger at and below Sea leval. That Mayor should have gone to jail .

Oh yes lets throw in bible versus can I join to \r\nColossians 3:22\r\nGenesis 34:21-31\r\nJudges 9:42-49\r\nthe many laws in Leviticus 19,20,21,24 that im sure you dont adhere to \r\nand just in case you say old testement does not count I refer you to \r\nMatthew 5:18-19\r\nLuke 16:17\r\nect ect \r\n \r\nseparation of church and stae are key here you keep you nonsense out of our goverment and the government keeps from making laws affecting you.\r\n \r\n  It comes down to this people they are wanting equal rights and they should have it what two consinting adults do that love each other is none of your business.  Im guessing next is we dont want them in our schools affecting our children then something like supermarkets and back of the bus status where will denying human rights stop for you? well i guess that depends on what knd of person you are. I know that in 20 years when my kinds ask where I stood on this issue I wont be ashamed to answer them.  \r\n \r\n  It comes down to this christian or no "Treat others how you want to be treated" get off your high horse, you are no better than anyone else on this planet.

I was never sure about the job that Chris Christie would do when he was elected Governor of the state of New Jersey.  But, my hat is truly off to him....he has a done a wonderful job in the state and continues to do so in the face of a horrible disaster.  I give him a lot of credit for caring about the kids going out in the midst of such devastation.  And, postponing it a week won't harm anyone.  I'm sure that parents can explain that when there is no longer a mess, they will do their trick or treating and still have as much fun.  Congrats to you Christie....job well done....keep up the good work.  And, if you ever decide to run for President, I am sure that many others, besides myself, will vote for you.

Mike Huckabee is a Republican not a Christian. If anyone in this board thinks otherwise they too are probably Republican. PEOPLE their is a difference between born again Christians and Sunday morning Christians. Their is a difference between the Mormon church and the Christian church. Wake up America, God is coming soon! That I know is true. There are too many catastrophic events happening in the world today.

I was nine years old and living in the Flatlands section of Brooklyn (about a mile from Jamaica Bay when our city was struck by the 1938 hurricane . I do not remember any excitement or fear or concern on its impending approach. I do recall a heavy storm with wind and rain. When I awoke the following morning the storm had passed and I believe the day was calm and sunny. What did impress me as went out and about were the numerous trees that had fallen into houses and into the streets Through the years I experienced another five hurricanes. Each one was memorable in itself but because it was my first I will always remember the experience of the 1938 storm. All of you who are experiencing Sandy will carry the memory of the experience with you for the rest of your life. A hurricane is a constant reminder that mankind is only as solid as nature allows.  s/ S. Markel

I wish people like him would stop trying to be the spokesperson for God...

(sorry, people.. all you who wish he was Muslim. are grasping at straws) \r\nIf he thinks Romney believes all other christian denominations are on par with him, he better think again.. Mormons consider themselves the only TRUE Christians there are.. not my words .. it's theirs.\r\nRead up on it all you christians for Romney.. you may be surprised.

There are so many, I don't know where to start. Maybe they should cancel channels instead. Let us chose which channels we want and what we don't so we don't have to pay for the trash we don't like.The cable companies throw this channel list down our throat without any say from the customer. If you want your favorite and only channels you watch, you must pay for 70 others. I truly only watch about 10 channels on cable and only watch local for the news and sports. There you go. That's only 14 channels i want. Why make me pay for 85?

Please do not cancel "Two and 1/2 Men"!!  Sure the focus has changed after Charlie Sheen left, what with all the women that were on the show, but Ashton Kutcher, John Cryer and Berta are still very funny! Jake, except  "skyping" on the computer, has grown!  But the hot Courtney Thorne-Smith (must be fun for Cryer shooting bed scenes with her), and the actress who plays Zoey just take getting used to, and is very attractive as well, and her cute TV daughter is a doll!  Might have to change the show's name (half-man is now full-man), but I vote NO to cancelling!  Jane Lynch, Charlie's therapist, is gone, but Evelyn, Judith and Rose remain, right?  Just new storyline need to be created!

Great points Legion-of-no-one... and, I will add, Islam isn't out there claiming to be 'just another' testiment, but also Christianity.  Islam admits it's Islam.\r\n \r\nAnother point is LDS President (1898 - 1901) Lorenzo Snow's whole. "As man is now, God once was; as God is now, man may become."\r\n \r\nI know plenty of people who aren't even religious or faithful who know that it is the highest form of blasphemy to say that God was once a man, and that man might become a god.

Pretty sad statement for the social evolution of man when many believe that they will redirect the ultimate responsibility for maintaining your own life in case of an emergency.\r\n\r\nA week or more of warnings and the endless methods of transportation to "get the f'ck outta the way", and you think you and your family would be best served to defer that flight and survival response to (pick any government on the planet) and after that pretend that you are someone important enough to have multiple people concentrating on saving YOU, not others.\r\n\r\nAlmost sickens me to see the devolution of the basic survival instinct, especially when you fa66ot bltches have the gall to snicker at survivalists, while crying and waiting for someone to come pull out your splinters!

I am no lover or hater of religion, do not support abortion as a form of birth control and I will at this time thank God that I have personally not had to endure the horror of being raped- and normally wouldn't wish harm to anyone, but as for Aiken and Mourdock on the whole rape issue, I have to say that if they (of course both MEN) were raped and had to carry and raise a child born of this violation- this wouldn't be up for discussion. Where in the bible does it say that a MAN has the right to violate and spread his seed to the unwilling? Sure when the MAN dies he will burn in hell for all eternity they say but that is little consolation to the women that have to endure the LIVING hell. \r\n \r\nOh that's right-what was I thinking- those women should just praise the lord that they lived through the experience and were BLESSED with conception, because the people wanting to run our country want to stand up for the rapists' fatherly rights. That's beautiful!! Do they have to pay child support sitting in prison- that is if they are ever caught? Who is responsible for the financial, emotional, and psychological issues in the up-bringing of this child? If politicians think it necessary to bare the child then the political party that supports this violation should have to personally financially support it or be FORCED to adopt the unwanted child. Good heavens- do they really think every raped woman out there that God didn't forbid conception is going to make a great parent? Is that would God would consider happiness on earth?

I agree a lot of these shows need to be canceled. What  I can beleive is the language and the things they say on TV, especially in prime time. I really think that it's getting out of hand.

AWWWW - looks like you bought a ticket to this clown show. There is nothing authentic to this relationship. It's all about publicity; and for the public to BUTT out would destroy the very purpose for which it was formed.

Pot C t K b ....\r\n \r\nWell said. The religious zealotry displayed by this faction is clearly out of synch with the  dictum that there shall be a clear and constitutionally recognized division of church and state. Huckabee and his misinformed following are caught up in some 'Dark Ages' morality play and are completely off base. Thanks for your remarks.\r\n \r\nPeace ~

as far as i'm concerned, two and a half men should've been canceled when chalie left. i know he was a problem at times, but he made the show. it's level of humor has dropped below the humor of a funeral. asston kreep is not funny. he's as funny as a fart in a space suit. john cryer reminds me of don knotts and the kid that plays whatever his name is, isn't a child any longer and just ain't cute any longer.

Huckabee is right on.  It is an abomination against God to take the life of another, exceptions may be in war or in self defense.  We are to have faith in God to help with other matters in life such as the economy.  Our judgment day will cover our entire life here on earth and, yes, how we vote will be part of that.  Huckabee is not saying you are condemned to hell because of how you vote. God does ask us to follow his laws first and to have faith in him to provide what we need.  Don't mistake wants for needs. If you have a relationship with God, you will know what he asks from us, it is in the Bible.  We are all called to be Christians-follow God.  I don't think God separates us as muslim, morman, jew etc.

Obama has been using religion as a political weapon to divide the American People \r\nin order to get more votes. Why can't Huckabee send a message to Christians that concerns a topic that has been on the political agenda?

Governor Christie is a leader, and he is taking care of business. Thanks to Governor Christie informing the public a while back that the President is a failure when it comes to being a leader.The President has attempted to monopolize television time by talking in circles and actually saying nothing.  Everyone knows that Congress has empowered FEMA to assist our neighbors that are enduring  hardship and sadness.  The Governor is doing an excellent job in handling the disaster.

A modern day coffin is sealed water tight. the bottom of the hole they are barried in is 6 feet. so if a coffin is 3 feet tall, that means that there is only 3 feet of dirt on top of that coffin. If the ground around the coffin is completely saturated, and turns to mud then it is pretty much just real thick fluid. Add a layer of water on top of that and there you have it. A COFFIN THAT COMES TO SURFACE.

Too bad they can't re-digitize a replacement for Jar-Jar Binks in those movies.  Just like they did for the original Jabba the Hut in "A New Hope".  Put some other character that isn't so irritating in it instead.  They can do anything now with computers.

lol. Along with what Adamus said, water vapor is harmless and used by nearly every living thing on Earth. We're mostly water. We, however, are not mostly carbon dioxide. While I respect your opinions Joe---even though I think they are misguided, that was a rather stupid question to pose. \r\n Hopefully, some of you look at your lives and try to help the planet in the ways you can. I'm not saying become a tree hugging hippie. Just be aware of your actions and how they affect the planet because they do and well live here. Think of that way. If you don't believe in global warming or climate change, what if it is real and your actions can help curb it from destroying us as a society? Would you not want others to do their part so your families have a shot at survival? Or are you so dead set on denial that you would rather have the do nothing/out of sight, out of mind approach? Personally, I'd rather give a damn and if I am proven wrong in the long run so be it. But the facts are there that shows those who believe in climate change are not wrong.

Yes, by all means, MG...Keep repeating the same old tired out mantra you have clung to over the years.  Its still not going to alter reality any more than fine Scotch...however, the Scotch makes more sense.  \r\n\r\nThe Powers that Be from the last centuries had the 'freedom' to build and the 'freedom' to depreciate worker life, liberty and assets (wages / benefits / safety)\r\nin order to pursue their 'dreams'.  Nobody on the Left denies them the ability to make dreams happen, only the 'freedom' to denigrate people, misallocate resources and misappropriate other's money (labor) to get there. \r\n\r\nThe People have met Transparency, old chap- They have seen through RoMoney.

Umm, the yearly average household income in the US is $50,0054. Divided by 26, that is $1925.15. Are you saying that thousands of Americans who WANT to work are making less than $2k/ year?  \r\n \r\nYeah, I get it. Sometimes people need to rely on the government during rough times. Some people are truly disabled and cannot and will never work. Still, there are LOTS of people out there who abuse the system. I've had people work for me who wanted their full-time status cut to just a few hours a week so that they can continue to receive welfare benefits. I have a client who told me that she is on disability for being so fat that she cannot work and she has no intention of trying to lose weight.\r\n \r\nFor hard-working, middle class Americans, this kind of behavior is a major slap in the face. We just want what is fair, too.

Quote of the decade.....a gifted speaker who tells you what you want to hear, but apparently has no intention of being true to it.  So I ask, what is he trying to sell us in the upcoming election?\r\n \r\n"The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the US Government cannot pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our Government's reckless fiscal policies. Increasing America 's debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means that, "the buck stops here.' Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better."\r\n ~ Senator Barack H. Obama, March 2006

I think only an idiot would not release his college transcripts and his passport data for 5 milliion.  Only an idiot; unless he has something to hide.  I can't believe there are so many robots that blindly believe whatever Obama says.  Of course if he didn't have something to hide then he already would have shown them, and he wouldn't have spent millions of taxpayer monies covering them up.  None truly know where he was born except his Mom.  But we can guess that he used the system and told Colleges and the American people whatever best suited him.  To College he was not born in America so he got "free" money.  To run for President he had to be born in America so that is also what he said.  So whats the truth, with all of the lies, I don't even think Obama knows anymore.  The one think we know is that he will say anything as long as its good for him.  We also know he will do and say anything to continue his goal of turning us into a 3rd world country.  This country is build on the prinicples of free business.  If all the socialists want to live in a socialist country then move to one.  Trying to change this one to being socialist only hurts it.

For me, the sun rises & sets on my little boy; so I'm very protective of him.  \r\nRight, wrong or indifferent; I think Kelsey took his baby to the Playboy Mansion because he knows babies are a chick magnet.  With that said, I can't be too critical of him for that without taking a long look in the mirrior at myself.\r\nDo I think Kelsey exercised good judgement here?  I don't know.  Speaking for myself, I think it's better to keep your kids close so you can be there for them, protect them & all the while, including them in your real life.  Kids are too sheltered these days & too many parents lead "double lives."  Kids eventually grow up to an age where they recognize the phony parent act & they rightly lose respect for them.\r\nI suspect the public school most of us send our kids to is far more dangerous than the Playboy Mansion is to Kelsey's daughter.

ROMNEY MANY TIMES YOU HAVE GIVEN YOUR OPINION ABOUT "FEMA". YOU WANTS TO CUT THE MONEY FOR FEMA AS RYAN AND CANTOR DID A WHILE BACK! YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN A FORM OF FEMA WHEN YOU BECOME PRESIDENT, AND GIVE THE BUSINESS OF PROTECTING OF OUR CITIZENS IN THE EVENT OF STORMS, EARTHQUAKES, HURRICANES TO A PRIVATE AGENCY TO MAINTAIN THE ORDER AND RESCUE OPERATIONS OF OUR CITIZENS. WITH THIS MASSIVE STORM THAT HIT US SO HARD, A PRIVATE BUSINESS TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE HAD BEEN A JOKE. NO PRIVATE FIRM CAN MOBILIZE THOUSAND OF GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL AND FIRST RESPONDERS ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY WITH PRECISION, ENERGY, TRUST AND PERSEVERANCE, AND FAST RESCUE PROCEDURES THAN A WELL ORGANIZED GOVERNMENT AGENCY TO HELP OUR PEOPLE CAN DO ---SO ROMNEY LEARN A NEW LESSON, WE DO NOT WANT YOU BECAUSE YOU WILL GIVE THE SALVATION OF OUR PEOPLE TO A JUNKY AGENCY THAT WILL BE SLEEP DURING THE WHOLE DISASTER! YOUR AGENCY WILL BE A DUPLICATE OF BUSH FEMA, AND THAT WE WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS TIME. SO GO ON TO YOUR CAR ELEVATORS AND MONEY A LEAVE US ALONG. VOTE FOR OBAMA THE TRUE CARE PRESIDENT ON NOV 6, 2012

This is the only CSI I watched I am so sick of shows set in New York City,the city has ugly back grounds shots and buildings, New York is a dirty city you can see the filth everywhere and with people that would not care if they saw a person lying on the street hurt. so to me shows set in New York City make me feel ill.Miami has lush backgrounds beautiful houses and people.To cancel a show because of the location esp when it some place like Miami is just plain STUPID. I think that it was canceled because of the night they put it on Sunday is a death curse for shows all most every week it get pushed aside because of football games, how can a show get ratings if you don't show it. I think CBS was dumb I would not watch that network now if they paid me.You guys broke my heart.

This guy gets Dummer and Dummer !\r\nRomney isn't a Christian ! Wake up, Huckabee !\r\nWhy would Christians vote for a guy that belongs to a cult named Mormanism ???\r\n   Obama is a Christian ! A Muslim wouldn't go to a Christian Church ! Obama even went to a Catholic School although he is a Protestant, both respectable religions in the Christian world.\r\n   Look up Minnesota Republican Senator Norman Coleman who yesterday said that the Republican Party wasn't going to reverse Roe vs Wade. He said George Bush didn't do it in 8 years and Romney wasn't going to do it either. It's just something you say to get the Christian vote ! A President couldn't change those things even if he really wanted to. \r\n   You better VOTE to keep your SOCIAL SECURITY and MEDICARE. People are getting older every day and you will need these things ; Believe Me !  ( Unless you make $21 Million/year like Romney )--- I'd gladly pay the $3 Million in taxes ! \r\n  Veterans---Romney thinks that going to " Mission " is the same as going to war ! I don't think his boys ever had a chance of getting their legs or arms blown off at " Mission " !

Tim Cook made the correct decisions on both counts.  I have followed Apple very closely since prior to even 1984 and have experienced all the ups and downs as closely as an interested outside person could do.  The Executive Team is fully capable as are the Apple employees.  Apple will clearly lead and move ahead. The stakes are very high and The Executive Team will move forward and lead.  They have the rare luxury of being able to make the best decisions for the company and the money to do it with now.  Look for Tim Cook and others to lead.

My family live in the small town of South Hill, VA at the border with NC.  This small town was almost directly north of Durham, NC for a reference of how far inland was the path of Hazel's eye.  I was 6 years old and at school in the first grade.  As the officials realized South Hill was in the path of the hurricanes eye, the school let out early.  My best friend's father was already home from work and decided to pick up the kids, so he called the mothers with grade school kids that lived on my street.\r\n\r\nMy friend's father drove up and about 6 kids, that I knew, jumped in his car.  My parents told me not to get in a car of anyone I didn't know.  I knew my friend's mother, but I had never met or saw my friend's father.  After he leaned towards me yelling "get in, get in" I began backing away from the car.  They drove off.\r\n\r\nBy now the wind was almost blowing me down.  I lived only 1 mile from the school, so I turned and started my walk home.  Now comes the part I can vividly remember to this day and still can't believe I survived the "walk" home.  My entire walk home had my facing the wind.  I do not exaggerate when I say I had to lean about 45 degrees forward to keep from being blown backwards.  I carried my kid's style lunchbox in my right hand, and my right arm was blown directly behind my body in a position parallel to the road.  It was pure human survival instincts that kept me moving forward with a 45 degree lean.  I had already started raining hard.  Occasionally the wind, which was steady a high percentage of the time, would suddenly drop and I would fall forward on my hands and knees.  By the time I struggled into my yard, I was dead tired and soaked wet.  \r\n\r\nMy mother must have been frantically looking out the window at the direction of the school.  She ran out in the yard, picked me up and ran back into the house.  My mother's emotions kept changing from pride to anger.  She was so angry with me for not getting in the car of my friend's father.  But she was so proud of me for not getting in the car of my friend's father.  She knew that I didn't know him.\r\n\r\nI don't remember any time frame for my struggle to go home from school - only one mile.  I'm guessing a 20 minute run/walk that I did everyday took me well over an hour.  I remember hearing loud noises that sounded like metal trash can being blown past me on the paved road and other loud noises I couldn't recognize.  But I wasn't afraid while struggling on my "walk" home.  It was only when my mother carried me inside our house that I began to cry.  I will NEVER forget that experience with the '54 Hurricane Hazel.  I was 6 then and now I'm 64.

Can you also say harder work than the average person is not willing to put in? Yes these results are not possible without steroids but what people don't realize is the amount of work it takes to reach this level. Please do your research on steroids if used properly it is not a fraction as bad as the average person says it is. Don;t blindly be little someones effort because you don;t know what your talking about.

There have been so many articles written in recent years that have proven that the oceans are rising and that coastal cities are in increasing danger from these types of events. We are seeing them more and more frequently which makes me wonder why our government isn't being more PROACTIVE instead of reactive.\r\n  We are in desperate need of jobs and these disasters are costing us billions of dollars. Why are they not creating jobs by building more levies, canals, breakers and such in these types of locations??? They will save us money, create jobs, stimulate the economy and help prevent people form living through these horrible disasters. Am I missing something here? I don't understand why these projects are not taking place.

Reader, you'd have to put something in place to require those same funds to be held for emergencies, but it's the right idea. When Joplin was hit last year, they had all of their emergency funds put on hold and then reduced because Hurriciane Irene hit in another state. Those were funds that Missouri had paid into FEMA and were entitled to get back.

@ Cheft, I understand that people are going to vote according to their convictions. If you feel that your religion is against a certain candidate, than that is fine, do not vote for the person.

Huckbee was talking to the Christians or those who proclaim to be Christians And he is right We vote for the candidate that most aligns with the moral precepts of God  obams dose not . As for me and my house we will serve the Lord. If that sounds foolish to you, you just fulfilled another prophesy of the word of God the living breathing word by the creator of everything. This country was founded on those very precepts. the true History of this country is not being taught instead we are taught to tolerate every corrupt,depraved,impure life style or government structure that comes along . God Bless The USA . repent and  turn  from your wicked ways he will heal your nation if you don't REAP it.

It's about child abuse--abusing one's own daughter: letting her eat and drink junk food, be rude to people, talk and whine like a baby, and generally allow her to be undiscilpined. Really pathetic. Never watched the show but saw her featured on Entertainment Tonight. The mother should be charged with child endangerment.

calmike\r\nI am sure it is easier for you to believe that life does not begin at conception because that makes it ok that your children were aborted. \r\nAs for Christians pushing our views on others I think you have it backwards. \r\nThe things we are fighting for and speaking out for are the way things used to be and should still be but many like yourself forced your ideas onto us and into our nations laws.

And we can fix all of the issues by what...printing more money? We can't afford another four years of Obama. We need a buisiness leader, not a political leader to fix the country. Yes, we should put more on the shoulders of the state governments. Much of the political corruption is in the state systems as well. Then the states would learn to be more responsible for their spending as well. Get people off of welfare, and into jobs, generate tax dollars instead of creating jobs in fixxing roads that don't need to be fixxed. Yes, let GM go bankrupt...sorry. They were an irresponsible buisiness. That's what happens. Someone else will fill the void if you give it a chance. Oh, and if you sign up for welfare, you should sign your right to vote away as well. YOU are part of the problem. No taxation without representation....NO  ​  REPRESENTATION WITHOUT TAXATION!

Yeah, let's let FEMA dry up. I mean after all, climate change is a hoax perpetrated by educated people for no apparent reason right? And surely, all these disasters don't have anything to do with it... right? It's just co-oincidence that I can wear shorts in late October. I don't care how many more examples of mother nature's wrath start occuring, humans have nothing to do with it. It's just natural climate change. Who cares that the record amount of Co2 just happens to coincide with the industrial revolution. The melting icecaps? Screw those polar bears, I can't use them for energy anyway. \r\nReally, c'mon folks, it's all about us, not our kids or grandkids. They can always live on the moon. Ask Newt.  \r\n  \r\nIf Romney thought proclaiming the world was flat would get him elected, you'd start hearing about now magic underwear can make us the center of the universe again like the old days.

What lyin Willardo says and does has no correlation to each other. He lies to meet his needs for the day..\r\nHow can any braindead, pathetic radical right wing cracked teanut dunce vote for this guy.\r\n \r\nThe repukes also want to ban invitro fertilization. Yet 3 of Willardo's children had this done to produce children. Now, he wants to outlaw it to get the votes of the evangelical crazies. He will lie and do anything to win. Then the evangelicals will probably get screwed if he is elected. His campaign manager called him an Etch a Sketch player. When he is elected you can't hold him to anything he promised.\r\n \r\nHis true allegiance is to the criminal corporate masters who are bankrolling his campaign so they get regulations eased to enable them to rob and steal from us once again as was done under Bush Bin Lyin and his criminal gang led by President Cheney.

I cannot really comment upon the many factors that no doubt lead Mike Huckabee to produce this video at this moment in history and will leave that to him to answer his critics.  However, I can comment, with dismay, at the religious illiteracy of the most vocal American critics at this moment in time.  In Christian tradition, being forged in the "refining fire" relates to the individual Christian's progress in moving personally toward more holiness in thought, word and deed while here on earth.  THAT is what the "blacksmith's forge" symbolism is about:  A person is forged, shaped, molded by authentic Christian principles, by God.  It is the "more of You, God, and less of me, the human person."  Of course this sort of message does not sit well with the spoiled, vengeful and immature in thought, word and deed crowd that currently holds the megaphone, both because most of that crowd are their own "little tin gods" and because they are so ignorant of major religions that they do not even understand the message, yet they attack the messenger.  And I continue to scratch my head:  What is so "revolutionary" about not murdering innocent life?  What is so hard to understand that I "get it" that you may want your abortion and BCPs, but that you do NOT get it that I do NOT want to pay for your abortion and BCPs with MY insurance premiums, and you should pay for your own personal items related to your own personal habits? (What's next - I have to pay for your auto-ignition breathalizer because you can't keep your booze bottle cap closed either? It's about personal responsibility, people!) What is so "shocking" that holy matrimony is one thing, and the legal fictions of "civil law marriage" or even a "civil union" for tax purposes and other similar pedestrian and earthbound money matters are quite another? (Pity that religious illiteracy does not even place the matter of God's providence on the public radar.  There would be less anger, fear and anxiety if that concept was known and trusted.)  I never cease to be amazed that God offers a banquet, yet the little tin gods and their tin god hero are starving.  Wake up! Turn around! And be happier then.  Thank goodness the election season will soon end.

So, let me get this straight... a lot of people on here are MAD because Donald made this offer?  I would like for ONE person to explain to me HOW offering to donate $5 million to a charity is a bad thing.  I mean, the ONLY thing Obama has to do is show some stupid paperwork.  If anyone was approached with the same offer... I think they'd do it.  I know I would, but then again... I don't have anything to hide... and $5 million could grately help a charity out... or split it up and help a few charities... who cares?  I would think that the people should be the main concern of the president... not hiding some documents from the public.  Come ON people... get a grip on reality!  And stop being SO selfish.

What an idiotic thing to say!  Some people have no homes, no electric..have lost loved ones and here we go with someone who hasn't a clue what the "real" people go through.  On top of all these people have lost they have to hear or see another idiot thinking they know what they're going to do with money which hasn't even been offered yet.  Maybe that's what this douche would do with the money since he probably has another 3 or 4 houses that he and his family could go to in case of a disaster.  These guys really gotta go!

thank god, someone has the courage to state what many want to but can't.  He has my vote. \r\n  \r\nI was in NO just after katrina, i know the that the disaster was torture for many people and I also know that Gucci would not have been on their minds if the Feds has risen to the task of ensuring that their homes would be rebuilt, their schools opened, with enough food to eat and water to drink.  lets face it,. gucci became the goal when all their other hopes were dashed, and they felt they had nothing else.   \r\n  \r\nWe had better response after irene, and the feds have improved, but I know of this last fema guy and he proved to be less up to the task than I expected.  he has certainly changed in recent years.  \r\nbut even after Irene,  people were out to take advantage of the storm and even their neighbors.   \r\n  \r\nToday Sandy, just another eyeopener.  Mr. King, in order to justify the funds, there needs to be better checks and balances in place.  the current system has holes so large one could drive a truck thru them.   \r\n  \r\nPeople deserve federal funds in light of disaster, and insurance companies should not hesitate when a distaster takes a home or even a life.  If you want people to use federal funds appropriately, then you have to make sure that they have the help they need when they need it and not have to wait centuries for the funds or reimbursement .  thats when the idea of gucci has an appeal - its easier than the paperwork required for fema funds.  \r\n  \r\nSandy arrived and left, I surrived, but I have no electricity, no edible food in the fridge, and the electric company will not tell us when our power will be restored.  The operators are rude and of no help. I may just consider coach, at my expense, not the feds.  Happy Halloween!

I wonder: did Mike Huckabee get a memo from on high that no one else was allowed to see?  Who in the hell does he think he is anyway?  Someone ought to tell him that a gig on Faux News confers neither omniscience or prescience.  In fact, in his case, it probably doesn't even confer an audience.

Appearing on the networks this morning, Christie, for the third day in a row, heaped praise on Obama’s handling of the storm. “The President has been outstanding in this,” he told the “Today” show. On “Morning Joe,” he said, “It’s been very good working with the President. He and his Administration have been coördinating with us. It’s been wonderful.” Speaking on CNN, Christie said that he had been mightily impressed by Obama’s accessibility throughout the crisis. “He gave me his number at the White House, told me to call him if I needed anything, and he absolutely means it.” Christie also pointed out that Obama didn’t once bring up politics in their conversations, and added, “If he’s not bringing it up, you can be sure that people in New Jersey are not worried about that, primarily if one of the guys running isn’t."

I'd like to add any show involving a toddler and her tiara, any show that came from or is related to "Jersey Shore", "Duck Dynasty" or any other show that has to do with following idiots doing "redneck" things, most especially anything that has to do with a "Housewife" (which is just so wrong a term to use for what are pretty much nothing but vapid, plastic-surgeried up females who happened to marry very well or are washed-up child actresses), and basically the majority of "reality TV" can be swept back under the proverbial rug.  None of it is actual reality, and I'm sick of us being a country that makes outright stupidity and utter outrageousness a commodity and reward people, immensly, with money and fame for it. \r\n  \r\nI can't believe "Whitney" lasted one whole season, much less got a nod for a second one, and in a prime-time spot.  I tried watching it, got through 3 minutes of ridiculous stereotypical parody of relationships, and just couldn't bear another second.  She may be funny as a stand-up (admittedly, I've never seen her otherwise), but she completely sucks in this travesty of a show. \r\n  \r\nI'm with you, Silly Nanny - leave "Hoarders" alone.  It's the only thing that makes me feel better when I'm just not in a housework kind of mood and things are in disarray (which is, approximately, %99.2 of the time -  LOL).

artiell1 \r\nYou have diarrhea of the keyboard again tonight.  If you're going to start talking about liars you should mention Barry Hussein Obummer's lies.  Like he's going to cut the deficit in half.  The unemployment rate will be under 5%.  He's going to have a transparent administration.  He's going to reach across the aisle.  He accused Bush of being UnAmerican for the deficit that Bush had but Obummer has doubled that amount.  Does that mean is Double UnAmerican?  He said that if he can't get these things done by the end of his first term then it "will be a one-time proposition".  He should just quit if he sticks to his own standards.  He says he says what he means and does what he says.  What a joke!

Seeming to be the only person with bodybuilding experience who has posted so far on this subject let me lay this out for you....Steroids enhance what weight training does for the body. Put simply, you still have to put the work in to get the results. However, the results just come easier. I do believe in the use of steroids, testosterone, HGH if deemed medically necessary. This is going beyond that. They are freaks to anybody who has never competed. To some, they are gross. To others, they are to be admired. Unless you have stood on stage and been through the mental and physical struggle that it take to get like this....you have no comment. There is a whole side of bodybuilding that doesn't involve steroids, the natural guys. But with the comments that I've read, you wouldn't know the difference even it smacked you in your non gym attending faces.\r\n\r\nBTW, if you're curious if I am just talking ****, google Jason Harang. The first 3 pictures that come up are of me in one of my shows.

Why did he sell off everything? I'm sure he's not hurting for money. I'm a huge fan. I love the movies. I personally love the novels though. I have read dozens upon dozens of Star Wars books. All eras, doesn't matter. The potential for film is endless. I'm not necessarily against putting out movies, but be tasteful about them, creative and whatever you do, stick with the continuity. If they flub one timeline or one piece of tech from one time when it didn't exist yet or a lifeform that hadn't been discovered yet then the whole film falls apart for people who truly love this franchise. Especially for those of us who appreciate how much of a stickler Lucas was about continuity when it came to his stories. It takes a committee to get an idea through in a book, so hopefully that attention to detail continues.

It wasn't Brown's fault in New Orleans, It was first the People who didn't evacuate, Second it was the Mayor and the Governor , Both Democrats.\r\nI have friends who lived there and both are Liberal and both said there was nothing anyone could have done that quickly.\r\nClinton gave New Orleans $96 Billion  To fix the Levies, WHY weren't they fixed? Oh CHIT, I forgot  They are run by Demorats.\r\nBy the way where in the Hell are the Democrats when Corzine Lost $ 1.1 Billion of people's Investments??????  Oh Chit I forgot he is a Demorat.\r\nWhere are they with Holder sending Gun's to Mexico? Oh Chit I forgot he is a Demorat.\r\nWhere are they with Oblamea giving money, Billions to Green Company's and than them going Bankrupt? Oh Chit , I forgot , He is a Demorat.\r\n Where are they when Americans were killed while asking for help? Oh Chit, I forgot People in charge are Demorats.\r\nWhere are they when $ 55 Million went to Afghanistan and disappeared? Oh Chit, Bush isn't in Office, They are Demorats.\r\n Where are they when Afghan Soldiers are shooting our Men in the Back? I forgot Demorats are in Charge.

Someone, \r\nWhile I applaud your resolve and conviction to vote against the "Establishment", the results of such action by you and others will actually benefit only Obama and his minions.  A vote for anyone other than Romney is the same as a vote for Obama.  I do not like the choice we have but unfortunately it is the only real choice if we want out of our current social quagmire that the U.S. is in. \r\n  \r\nOn a second note, I do agree 100% with your comment about KOO.

Of course it's all about the money, as with any other series.  If Star Wars sucked really bad, do you think The Empire Strikes Back would have ever been made?  I hope Disney doesn't screw it up.  After all Obi Wan Kenobi once said, "Who's more foolish: the fool, or the fool who follows him?"

Besides speak badly about Mr Romney, what have YOU done FOR the Country??  You people are part of the 47% that are lazy, feel (and act) the victim, and will not vote for the only candidate that will actually HELP Our Country... obama has proven he has no idea how to help the Country.   \r\n  \r\nIf you vote for that baffoon in office now, well, then you deserve everything you get...

If there was ever any a dumb idea that so damaged and discredited the acceptance and proselytism to the lame-brained cause efforts of a pantheistic religious organization like PETA, Dina Kourda of Irvine, CA, has jumped over-board in her own fish guts!  Imagine, for even a fleeting moment, the real possibility of a devolved government to realize and endorse the embracement to such an 'embittering gall." This type of ill-honoring rouge thought, to spend tax dollars or bow credence to any group or person (as if a wannabe pro-successor to the late humanistic pseudo-prodigist moron like Margaret Mead), by its very nature, should have that resident, and its like-type scum to be evaluated for drug abuse, over-indulgence of broad-spectrum food additives, consuming contaminated FDA approved city drinking water, and be cited/registered as a social terrorist. Lets all put blindfolds on, walk past any fish market, sniff, smile, and shout, "Hi Dina!" :)

I don't understand why this seems to be considered a threat.  Women at the top have made all kinds of sacrifices for their careers.  The only thing unusual about sacrificing family bonding time for career is that it was expected of men, and expected of women to support them.  Isn't this kind of choice what women's lib was all about?  Seriously.. do you think Jack Welsh took paternity leave?\r\n\r\nWhen you're in a position that doesn't easily have a backup like a CEO or other exec, your family extends to the company.  You need to be accessible all the time, and sometimes at the expense of your blood family.  You can be reasonably sure that if there's an earning release or meeting with auditors on that kid's birthday, he's getting a phone call saying "Happy Birthday, we'll have cake this weekend!"  I applaud her for being able to manage the conflicting roles as well as she appears to be.

Huckabee has no right to bring God into politics nor can he speak for God. How we live our lives and our beliefs in God determine our fate when our time in life is over. HE made each of us unique, my belief in God has nothing to do with politics! God teaches us to forgive others and NOT to use His name to convince others to follow others because they choose to speak for Him. We each have the right to our opinion as to what is right and what is wrong in the eyes of God. God speaks to each of us through His own unique way. I do not feel as I will be condemed by God for my right to choose in how I vote. I live my life with the guidence from God. Never will I live my life by the words of anyone other than God. I will not shame Huckabee for his beliefs as they are "his beliefs". I do feel as though to speak publically as to condemn us by our vote is the opposite of how God  has tought us.

I continue to be amazed at the hate and viciousness of people who call folk like Mr. Huckabee by the same names. We Christians have come to expect such pettiness from an increasingly secular humanistic political elitest world that seems bent on forcing that way of life down a Christians throat, makng us just as apt to compromise our moral ideals as they are to run from them.\r\n \r\nFurther, I dont see the same venom being directed towards people who really DO pose a threat to our way of life, people who hate us just because we are American. Also, I did not find it necessary to use profanity nor call you guys/gals filty names in order to make my point. \r\n \r\nIt is time, high time, and past time for high profile people of faith like Mr. Huckabee to come forward and add their voices to all the others. You dont have to agree with them. But they have just as much right to add their views to the national conversation as you all do. We are tired of being told to 'hush up." So you all just need to get use to hearing us. And in my case, dont expect me to engage you in dialogue if the best you can do is demonize me for having views that are contrary to yours. Nor will I respond to childish hateful diatribe full of profanity and name calling. Lets talk TO one another, not AT one another....just another voice...

Richard      You wanting it to be a 'Christian" nation doesn't make it one. There is no established state religion thankfully. Not a week goes by without some religious nut proclaiming women's bodies stop rapist's sperm from impregnating them; the Earth is 6000 years old etc. etc. If we were a theocracy you could ban the teaching of evolution in every university and we could start our walk back into the dark ages. I have Jewish,  and Muslim kids in class. Are they not part of this nation?

"If this was not an election year, he would have done it exactly like he just did." \r\n  \r\nTell that to the people on the Gulf after the BP Oil Spill, they are still trying to recover and he added insult to injury by stopping drilling in the Gulf. \r\n  \r\nHe also let Texas Burn and would not release planes to fight the fires. \r\n  \r\nHe also allowed the Benghazi Embassy to be overtaken resulting in 4 deaths......there would have been 30 deaths if the 2 Brave Seals had not given their lives to save most of them....it was a election year and his agenda took priority. \r\n  \r\nIf you people are naive or sinister enough to think this will give him 4 more, then you are as sick as he is.

So great was man's need to worship something that they carved gods out of wood, stone or metal. Gods served the following purpose: \r\nThey were used to explain the unexplainable \r\nThey were used to control or belittle others (mostly women) and exert one's own superiority. (Narcissists often seek positions of power and control) \r\nThey were used to satisfy the human need for rituals and to be someone's bitch \r\nThey were used to cover up for past sins and misdeeds \r\n  \r\nIn time it became obvious that carved idols were useless. "Gods" needed to become invisible at that point.  \r\n  \r\nIf you are a fool who buys invisible products, "Gods" are for you. It's the oldest scam in the book.

As a Christian, I cannot and will not support a party and a candidate that thinks the poor are lazy bums who don't want to take care of themselves.  Romney's 47%.  Or a party that claims all life is sacred, but only from conception until birth.  Single mothers are all "hos"  Candidates that say marriage is a sacred bond between only a man and a woman, but are on their 3rd or 4th marriage.  With a mistress on the side.  Want to force eveveryone to follow their beliefs, just like the Taliban. \r\n  \r\nAs a Christian, I refuse to vote for a person who is anti-abortion, but whose other positions violate the Bible and my own spiritual beliefs.

No. Under the Romney disaster plan you will contact your local private disaster response team and schedule an appointment. You will either have to pay cash at the time of the visit or have a policy in place already. You will need to wait until the upper penhouse owners are serviced with their daily caviar but they will get to you when there is an availability in the schedule. Please be sure to fill out the customer satisfaction form when it is mailed to you. Look for coupons in your local publication.

yeah star wars sucks regardless, if the avengers is any indication of what disney can do then more power to them! sure it'll be PG, be about as dark or violent as finding nemo and fanboys will complain til the cows come home, but we're all gonna shell out the $$ and see it anyway. the merch will still fly off the shelves and disney will make another few billions, life goes on guys! as i said before, star wars is cute and all but unless you're a straight up nerd its nothing any regular person would honestly complain about.. spaceships, explosions bla bla bla wtf else do you expect?

Romney will say, "let NYC go bankrupt." His rich butt-buddies need the tax cuts more than we need another big city full of dem voters, in his warped estimation, as instructed by karl rove and the kock brothers. Hit the showers mittwitt, you've bled this country for all you're gonna get with your holdup of the GM bailout when you and your buddy Paul the vulture Singer bought out Delco, then hijacked the US for 15 billion to stop you from liquidating the company. You are scum, mittwitt, bring back the tens of millions you profitted on this deal and have hidden in the tax haven jersey isle near france. For the full story read the Nation magazine or Greg Palast's "billionaires and ballot bandits." and find out what kind of crook the gop has on their ticket this time. O'bomber is no jewel, but mittwitt is pure scum.

For profit disaster relief?  Is this guy for real?\r\n \r\nFor profit health care gives us one of the lowest ranked health care systems in the world.  For profit jails gives us the highest prison population in the world.  What the hell would for profit disaster relief end up like?\r\n \r\nDoesn't seem like a large leap from that to for profit law enforcement.  \r\n \r\nEvery female and human being making under $ 1, 000, 000/year should be scared as hell if this is what is voted in.

Thank God Lucas is no longer in charge. He did great with the first three movies in the '70's, but he lost his vision with the three new movies. \r\n  \r\nLucas messed up big! The new movies were a special effects bonanza but he almost destroyed star wars. I really hope Disney does a good job with the next three movies.

My intent is not to offend but rather to add a point of view.\r\nThe man was speaking to God's people. \r\nThe point he seems to be trying to make is that this nation needs to turn from our wicked ways. That would include same sex marriage, and abortions. To do so we need to vote for candidates that support and protect the things we as God's people value. If we don't then this nation will likely feel the wrath of God. He was not saying a vote for democrats or Obama will send anyone to hell.\r\nGod has demonstrated many times that when his people turn their backs on him they reap his wrath. \r\nThink events of recent history are a coincidence?\r\nGod seems to like the number 7.\r\nLet's look at some interesting information.\r\n2 Hurricanes hit the same city exactly 7 years apart. To the very day. Both times it interfered with a pro-homosexual event there.\r\n21 years ago a hurricane hits GWB's house when he was holding a summit to try to separate Israel, God's chosen peoples country.\r\n21 years later we have two presidential candidates who want to do the same thing and we get another hurricane that formed on the day of their last debate.\r\nNot to mention the fact that most of the states hit by the hurricane have legalized same sex marriages or unions. Plus 2 of the states are set to vote on the issue in November.\r\nCoincidence or Wrath of God?\r\nNot convinced take a hard look at 911   We basically said no problem we don't need God we will rebuild and be stronger than before. Then 7 years later our financial system collapsed. Our country has not recovered. In fact we are now worse off than ever before. But our Government would rather we believe that it is ok to print 40 billion in new money a month. Hyper inflation is headed our way unless we do something.

I think Mr. Christgau's point about a lot of the Townsend book being "this happened and than that happened and then the other thing happened" without a real, or at least a deep, sence of him and his reaction to all of it was well taken.   \r\n  \r\n     Also, man, does Townsend make being a rock star, with gorgious women throwing themselves at you all the time, sound terrible, sad and depressing or what? The man makes John Calvin look like a party animal.  One thing you gotta say about Townsend's book, though,he does not try to make himself look good, ever--it almost feels like some kind of a spiritual exercise--how close can you stay to the bare, ugly, depressing truth and still get out of bed in the morning.  Very brave and admirable in its way--just kills the whole rock star fantasy element for everyone.  I kept wondering if there wasn't a David Lee Roth bio I could turn to for relief.

If a baby is not a human being until it leaves its mothers womb, what is it while in the womb? Every time a human egg is fertilized in its mothers womb, and is carried to birth, a human being is always born. If it is "just" a fertilized egg, or a fetus of some sort, why aren't female human beings giving birth to frogs, or rabbits? Life, human life, All life, DOES begin at conception my friend.

So many silly, ill informed comments.  The credit reporting system is not perfect but it is not a scam to jack up interest rates.   The reality is that the federal government has made several strong moves in the last 3 years to fix the broken credit reporting system.  As a loan originator who works on commission, I have every reason to want to see every application I take get approved.  But there are times when common sense and good conscience cause me to tell people that based on their scores, they simply aren't ready to take on a financial commitment (aka...a home loan) worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. There are many cases in which low credit scores are the product of actual hardship such as a serious illness, long term layoff or unemployment, or a death of a wage earner.  But 7 out of 10 times when I see a low score it's due to a prolonged pattern of very bad money managment.   I can tell by looking at the number of defaults and late payments by people who have no hardship at all.  They are simply prone to living well beyond their means.  The rules of good credit management are easy to find and easy to follow.  Establish and follow a budget, live within your means, pay your bills on time, and try to keep your use of any particular credit account well below 50% of the spending limit.   If you have to sacrifice a trip to Hawaii or Mexico in order to pay off late bills, that's life.  Grow up and act like an adult and not a pleasure driven adolescent.   Imperfect as they may be, credit scores in and of themselves still serve as a fairly reliable barometer or predictor of how likely it is that a loan applicant will actually be a trustworthy borrower.  If the banks and government had paid more attention and denied low scoring applicants the oversized jumbo loans on which many of them are now defaulting, it would have compelled borrowers to purchase more affordable homes.  They would have had to live within their means.  The failure on the part of banks and Bush era regulators led to millions of homeowners taking out loans they could ultimately not afford.  The cost to the economy, the cost of government programs to try to stem the rate foreclosures could have been avoided had the government actually forced lenders to pay more attention to credit scores.  They are an imperfect but still useful tool that can be used to discern which borrowers are most likely to reliable and which are likely to be financially risky.  The goal isn't to prevent people who have made financial mistakes from buying homes, but rather to use the scores to define borrowing limits thereby causing people with bad financial skills to purchase more affordable houses so that they don't get into trouble.  You are allowed to pull one free credit report from each bureau per year.  A good idea is to stagger them so that you can get a fresh look at your report once every four months to be certain that their aren't glaring errors or even worse, entires that indicate identity theft.  Regulators in the WA state recommens pulling scores through annualcreditreports.  ​ com because they won't try to sell you extra services.  The free report agencies are not government agencies but rather for-profit groups so it is they, not the government or the banks who are scamming you and trying to sell you extra services.  If you are being dinged on your score for over using credit cards or lines of credit, lower the balances by transfering parts of your high balances to cards with lower balances.  The general rule of thumb is keep the balance on any one card below 33%, and never exceed 50%.

FEMA is one of the centralized government agencies that i 100% support as is.  There is need for coordinated efforts and the federal system of communication and resource coordiantion with the states is fundamental in ensuring continuity in the event of a natural disaster.  This is one agency where the need for federal assessment of damages and sharing of resources is definitely in the best interest of National security and safety.  States do have their own emergency response operations systems and communications as well, but there are times when its necessary to work through the steps with FEMA in order to maintain a level of objectivity and situational awareness that may get beyond the scope of local and state command structures.

How can anyone say Obama is a Christian?  You need to look at all the things he has done against Christians.  He banned the Military hospitals from giving out Christian literature or having bibles in the rooms of Patients in those hospitals.  He ordered the burning of bibles because of the koran being burned previously.  there are so many more things that I cant recall all of them.  He banned National day of prayer, but then incorporated the day for Muslims to pray at or near the white house in a government building and he himself prayed with them.  He is a Muslim.

The concept we are working under is that no one knows how, where or when a gigantic disaster will occur, but if it happens in America, America will take care of it. That's how it is supposed to work. It is un-American to believe individual states should be left to defend for themselves, just as it is un-American to believe an individual American should be left to defend them self. This concept even has a name. It's called "The United States" of America.

I may not be a Huckabee fan, but he is right on this issue.  You cannot claim to be a Christian and blantantly ignore Biblical teachings.  \r\n \r\nPractically, this is all politics.  There are a large number of evangelicals who have reservations about voting for a Mormon.  This is Huckabee's way of throwing his (evngelical) support behind Romney to get the evangelicals past that objection.

What it sounds like to me is that this author would prefer that every network air old stuff like Happy Days and I Love Lucy. This is 2012, not 1982. The world has come a long way technologically in that 30 years. Society and American culture have evolved since then. The majority of the world isn't into muscle cars and hanging out at the local diner. Women have all the opportunities that men do (and in some cases more). The stereotype isn't the typical June Cleaver stay at home in a dress and apron baking and cleaning. Women are going to college, having careers, and being more independent. What I'm getting at is that it's obvious that this author has become accustomed to a certain type of television programming that he likes, but that's not where the majority of the population is. I recommend he tune into Nick At Nite or TV Land to see those shows, and let the majority enjoy the programming that we want. I'm all for canceling Glee, it's a dumb show. I'm all for canceling American Idol, we have too many singing competition shows so cancel all of them. But good shows like Two and a Half Men, How I Met Your Mother, Whitney, and Grey's Anatomy shouldn't be canceled. Let them run out their lives. When the ratings get low enough, the networks will cancel them anyway. That's what they do with new shows. They cancel them before the show has a chance to get good ratings.

I spend more time here because I'm humored by the lack of intelligence folks like you offer. I read many articles from many news sources because I don't want and refuse to limit my knowledge by JUST one or two.  \r\n  \r\nI have to to stay ahead of the "regular liberal" mindset. I must admit that republicans are similar in that they resort to mainly Fox but I do know that they (the republicans) are wiser and are not so quick with idiotic and frankly childish responses such as yours.  \r\n  \r\nI would guess that you're fed up with being a loser and, besides blaming yourself, it's much easier to blame them. Don't give up though, hopefully you won't be a loser your whole life.......maybe you'll get the handout you've always wanted.

As a big Star Wars fan, and toy collector, this story has been the talk of the fan community.  Many people aren't sure what to make of it, but are trying to see it in a good light.  Many were very disappointed in the prequels and wished that Lucas had taken better care of the franchise.  I myself am trying to look at it positively and hope that Disney will do right by Star Wars.  I also with many others, are now busy speculating what the next movies, will entail.  If there is any way to get at least Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher in the new films, that would be great.  I don't want them to go the way the Star Trek series went, and try to totally change what has come before.  I love Star Wars, and want, what is best ,for it.  Please don't screw it up for us.

When Wilma hit in 2005 a few days before Halloween, we were also left without power and plenty of damage around the city. But I was determined to not let that ruin what my kids had been counting on all month long, so I drove them to the nearest mall (that had power) and we trick-or-treated there. It was safe (better than going to a neighborhood you're not familiar with), they still got candy, and got to see plenty of kids with their costumes. =)

Get some facts before you pretend to have medical knowledge and text your biases. The flu vaccine isn't perfect, but it prevents a lot of flu cases, and it is inactivated (except for FluMist, which you shouldn't be taking if you are an adult), so it does not cause influenza infection. If you think you got the flu from the vaccine, you are incorrect. A certain number fo viruses are active in the autumn when we get flu vaccine, so *someone* is bound to get a cold after the get the vaccine. What else did you do 4 days before you got the vaccine? Go to the mall? Maybe that's why you got sick.

I live in West Springfield, MA. Last year, October's storm made our town look like a war zone. It took weekes to recover power in all parts of the town. Halloween was entirely canceled. This year, our town was spared from the same kind of damage so I will take my daughter out tonite  :)

Not that I'm complaining, but why were Leonardo and Raphael cloned while Donatello and Michelangelo were not?\r\n \r\nI most heartily approve of the sex (and species) change though.\r\n \r\nOh yeah, KEANU REEVES SUCKS!!! One of the absolute worst actors ever to have been hired.

the worst thing that i've seen a bar owner do:  being an employee and working that night, a couple of fellas came into the bar that night and flopped down a large amount of money and said buy 2 rounds and keep the change.  the owner was sitting there and heard this.  the fellas had one drink and left.  i bought two rounds for the bar and put the rest in my tip jar.  my boss got up and took the tip out my jar and rang it up in the cash register and left me a $2 tip.  thats all i'm sayin before i type somethin very bad!!

Yes, and until lately there were a couple of judges in PA (I believe) willing to sentence juveniles into labor camps to pay back their funders...Until they were discovered. \r\n\r\nGiven the influence of Big Money in this financial cosmos, we are still only a hairs-\r\nbreadth away from re-living the "good old times" of the Gilded Age IF WE ARE LUCKY. I have a strange notion the new breed would like to take us back to the Feudal Age even more.  \r\n\r\nAnd People still feverishly cling to all the "job creators", "supply side", "get the handouters and burn them at the stake" fables, even after all the results of those policies from the Hard Right continue to haunt  and hurt us...  OMG !!!!

Every one has thoughts about Star Wars. A new generation will have Star Wars for themselves, just like people from the '70s and '80s. The older ones need to shut up and let the younger ones have something for themselves. Who knows, they may be just fine, even great, only time can tell. Criticize if you need but let things play out and see what really happens.

OK, I like the royals.  I'm from Texas and I've spent most of my life in the United States.  BUT:  I can read and write and can tell time and speak as if I came from Denver, CO. And I wear clothes and everything.  I even walk and sit and stand up and do it with my mouth closed.  I can even drive a car.  Now here is what I would like to add to all this.  Do you think the following people are great and wonderful?  Allen West, Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Bob Kasten, Dick Cheney, Donald Reumsfeld, Eliot Spitzer, Eric Cantor, George W. Bush, Glenn Beck, Grover Norquist's ghost, Jeb Bush, Jeff Sessions, Joe Barton, John Boehner, John McCain, Karl Rove, Koch Brothers, Lee Atwater's Ghost, Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio, Mitch McConnellll, Michele Bachmann, Newt Gain-dah-ridge, Nixon's still living friends, Paul Ryan, Phil Graham, Rick Perry, Rodger Aies, Romald Reagan's still living friends, Sarah Palin, Scott Walker, Tom TeLay, Rish Limbaugh .... I could go on but this ought to be enough.  I know, I know what ANY and all will say in response to this: "You ought to get a life, fellow...."

Is this really 1 Classic Lady using an alter-ego? Cuz I sure could swear that with all the paranoid-schizophren  ​ ic LARGE CAP letters and ignorance it was. First of all, Socialism is freakin' awesome and has nothing to do with Communism. A socialist country has a parliament whereas Communism has a dictator who uses his military power to control the politburo. There is no Soviet Union anymore. Russia and Cuba have some of the most intelligent and well-trained people in the world. Are you really a crazy old trailer lady?\r\nWell, in this country, even white trash can become rich and famous like Honey Boo Boo Child. Why don't you get off your assets and find a job to improve yourself? It would help your condition to get out of the trailer once in a while.

The states can't afford to rebuild the economies, they need the help of the government. Government is for the people.\r\n\r\nSome people in the U.S. sure do complain when other governments don't help their own citizens. Romney would be just like those governments.\r\n\r\nThe only "private" sector that can pay to rebuild economies is the very wealthy.  They would get richer because they could force people to pay exorbitant prices.\r\n\r\nRomney is so incredibly thoughtless and out for the very wealthy only.

*Sigh*  Unfortunately, this very young man is a likely victim of ignorance and quite possibly poverty.   I am a nurse and am a humanitarian volunteer for people, many whose circumstances are much less than what most of us know and take for granted.  There are many "old wives tales" that circulate around and are used; it's part of different cultures.  (Liquor has long been used as as a mild sedative and analgesic.)  Often they have disastrous consequences, but without education, the cycle is never broken.   \r\n Instead of being so quick to crucify what was likely an honest attempt to help an infant, in a very wrong and incorrect way, get out and volunteer to help and teach those in your own community. Change doesn't come without action, right?

Too many job changes on a resume are a red flag to some employers.    \r\n \r\nA - You don't want to invest in someone who isn't going to hang around long enough for the payoff.  \r\nB - Job hoppers are  leaving jobs before the long term results of their contribution can be assessed and often before the real challenges of a job  even kick in.    It's easier to get to the top than to stay there.  Leaving is a way to pretend you stayed there.

sorry my friend the muslim thing is old and nobody believes it. as for the fabric of this country what eactly is that. this country was not built by the rich and privilaged it was built by the poor and middle class. it is not theamerican dream to be born to a rich family and never have to work a day in your life, the dream is to have the chance to get the same education as the wealthy, to have the same healthcare as the wealthy, to have the same oppertunity as the wealthy to suceed in life, liberty, and freedom. to work hard and be rewarded for that hard work not forced to pay taxes so the wealthy can get  excess

Amazing is the amount of ignorance in America today people need to grow up really. We have a person running for president that until recently owned stocks in Chinese companies, ships American jobs off to foreign counties, has off shore bank accounts, Mitt Romney profited by at least $15.3 million (GM Delphi Automotive) from the auto bailout. Will not release any more tax statements for fear that America will see the truth on what he is hiding. Romney urges business owners to tell their employees how to vote or risk losing their jobs. The draft dodger wants to take America to more unfunded wars in Iran, Syria and continue to occupy Afghanistan so that his cronies can get rich while America becomes a true third world country. This guy failed as governor (38% approval rating) and people think he is qualified to run the country!

You are aware that of the five (5) states hit by hurricanes in 2004 and 2005, four of them are very happy with the FEMA response.  The only one that isn't is the one that REFUSED PERMISSION to FEMA to enter the state...Louisiana.\r\nYou did KNOW that the federal government can't just go into a soveriegn state without permission from the governor, right?  I mean, that is pretty basic info there.  Like it is pretty basic info that the idioot woman that was governor of La. refused to let FEMA in for a WEEK!\r\nAnd some prople are so stupid they blame Bush.  instead of the democrat governor that refused help.   Go Check!

First they want to cut Grandma's medicare and now gut FEMA and let those 47 percenters in NJ and the east coast get the opportunity to stand on their own two feet.  Why do such self-professed Christians act so uncharitably towards those in need?

@Wheresthecoltsd, the difference is that Obama's administration told would-be reinforcements to "stand down" multiple times, even as the now-dead SEALS had their lasers focused on the morter sites.  Would have been a textbook style military strike.  Obama just sat back and watched them die.  This isn't policizing the issue - it's calling out an incompetent administration for what it is.  Incompetent.

IMHO the issue with FEMA is that it is run at the national level. It should either be a state run entity or a regional entity. That would allow each area to have what it needs based upon it's own history. Not some national group trying to be everything to every one.\r\n That concept does not work ever.

NO HE WON'T....He was in Ohio today and several people asked him if he supports FEMA and he would not answer the question. The trouble with Romney is he has made too many promises to so many groups that he is now afraid he will say the wrong thing! That's what happens when you are a liar like he is. For 2 years he has flipflopped so many times...it's like he says " I don't know what I said but I stand by what I said whatever it was! duh what a loser! He will do the same with Medicare...that voucher will get you no where when you try to use it not to mention you will have no Social Security...because GW borrowed from it when he was in office. Clinton had a balanced budge and look what happened when those Republicans got in. I believe God would want FEMA to help everyone in need and those people in the storm need all the Government help they can get. Thank God for the FEMA and Thank God for all the volunteers.

You'll have to forgive me for disagreeing that abortion and gay marriage are even on the radar, much less the high end when we have so many other, larger issues at stake!

It's funny to me that people are going on about "Don't ruin Star Wars"...Lucas already did that when he released Episodes 1-3. They were terrible for so many reasons. It couldn't possibly get worse than that. In fact, I hope Disney has the good sense to re-make Episodes 1-3 as well as re-release the unedited versions of Episodes 4-6 on Blue-Ray. I also hope they get Peter Jackson to direct the new films. He's one of the few directors capable of handling the task of telling an epic tale on the big screen while striking an appropriate balance between the story and the cinematic magic on a blockbuster scale.

Completely agree with all of them.  Need to get rid of all the reality shows.  Two and a Half Men needed to go way before Sheen had his melt down and got fired.  There was way too much adult content for prime time.  Why can't something be funny without being "dirty"?  Some of the shows, like "How I Met Your Mother" have run their course even though they were very good shows.

Marchionne validated that Romney was WRONG via e-mail then media release yesterday. There is a small Chinese plant managed by Americans from the Detroit operations. They build a different version of the Jeep Grand Cherokee for Asia. No, not easily converted to US Standards. Marchionne all but called Romney an idiot, but he should have.

I am not a Christie fan, but He is doing the best he can right now with what has happened to New Jersey. He is just looking out for the safety of the citizen. He has all he can handle right now and does not need to be put down for his efforts. Maybe in a few weeks he can get back to being a no good politician like he really is, but for now give the guy a break

He is just saying get the money into the right hands of those who really need it.  There is so much abuse that happens in time of a catastrophe.  The ones that are sick are the ones that abuse the system & take the money to use on frivolous things when others are going without because of their abuse of the system.

When Mr Huckabee replaced Paul Harvey, the show became political instead of entertaining. Unfortunately, it became another version of Rush Limbaugh.  Sadly, an american icon was replaced by someone who would stoop to threatening voters. Paul was above that.

Don't really care about anyone's opinions of what shows they like. Its too subjective a subject.  My only judgement is if I get at least one good laugh a show, and Two-and-a-Half Men, while I definitely do miss Charlie, still makes me laugh enough to say "leave it on!"

I agree with the majority of his/her selections except Glee, Ice Loves Coco and Grey's Anatomy.  I don't like most of the reality TV shows.  I don't understand why anyone cares why anybody would have 19 children.  I grew up in NYC back in the 60's and TV was black and white and there were only 5 channels.  The shows were brand new and the ideas were original. Now everything is copycat.  PBS is the best.  Downton Abbey, Call the Midwife, Doc Martin, etc.  Some of the newer shows are pretty good, SMASH, Revenge, Once Upon A Time.  The Networks need to do a little pruning.  In addition, what makes these TV actors worth so much money.  People are still living on $10.00 an hour.  Let's put some reality in TV.  Thanks for listening

People of the Gulf coast state deal with this multiple times during our lifespans.  This is the reason we pack up and flee when one is heading our direction.  Over the past years there has been criticism about our "refugees" and them not going back home.  The pictures you see are what we experience, and many people never go back because they don't want to go through it again.  I feel sorry for these people because i know what they are going through.  I have moved back home and have survived a near miss and recently a, mild, direct hit.  The people up there are suffering and need our prayers and support.  The idiots posting and complaining need to keep their comments to themselves.  It is very disturbing to know some of you are that sour of a human being.

I totally disagree with your sentiments...This is coming from a Star Trek fan who nearly threw up in the theatre during the 2009 reboot because I suddenly had a visceral emotional reaction to the fact that I would never see Bill, Lenard, De, Nichelle, Jimmy, George and Walter together again on the big screen...getting past that I was able to enjoy the film and look forward to next summer's new feature. (Still ticked about Abrahm's screwing with Star Trek Canon but that's another conversation). \r\n \r\nI am and always have been a huge Disney fan and I believe that having the Star Wars franchise under their wing will likely improve the emotional resonance of the characters. We were blown away by the original Star Wars in 1977 because it was a huge leap in technology and at the same time a real throw back to rip roaring story telling. What happened as time went by is Star Wars got too focused on technology, I think it is the reason George Lucas took so much criticism from the fans. Some of the most interesting interactions between characters ended up on the cutting room floor because character development interfered with the movie's pacing. (Review the deleted scenes on the DVD for Chapter II). \r\nI am looking forward to the first new Star Wars movie in the new trilogy and think Disney will do a great job. I do remember reading in Starlog (anybody remember that magazine?) That George always planned to do a squel trilogy until he became overly sensitive to the fan feedback. He also said he thought the novels did a pretty good job of telling the stories he had planned to tell about Luke, Leah & Han.

These are sad times for TV sitcoms.  Our children will look back with disdain at the greed of the networks to try to sell such meaningless and lackluster shows as 'The Kardashians...', 'Housewives of ..' , 2nd generation of 2 1/2 men, Pawn stars..., and anything else with a laugh track.  And what's up with the History Channel and shows like Roadside Truckers and the other crazy show that follows some sorry looking guys killing alligators.  It's an anemic and talentless time for TV.  Please, can we just skip this century!

Not if God exists and we will all stand before him in judgment. You assume that God does not exist, therefore in your words it is "fu...ing stupid" to consider whether or not you support what the Bible says is sin (homosexuality, abortion, etc.). \r\n\r\nIf God does not exist then you have a point. If God exists, you are in the worst of all positions because you are mocking others for considering their decisions that are trying to please God.\r\n\r\nIf what you do, good or bad, will last an eternity, then it is by far the smartest choice to weigh your decisions carefully and it is you who is "stupid."  I will not denigrate you by using your own vulgarity.

That pathetic "food drive" in OHIO (of course) should prove to everyone how shallow Romney is.  A canned food drive? that's ridiculous considering the magnitude and considering Red Cross specifically does not want "stuff", costs too much to sort and store.  and Ohio for the event after saying he was suspending campaigning out of respect for Sandy victims?  I'm amazed he actually thinks we are that stupid (we're limited, but not THAT bad).

Fragu, bigred, Judy, Rserp, and all other uninformed and misinformed libtards.\r\n \r\nHundreds of trucks of supplies have been on the road from LDS storhouses since Friday and Saturday on their way to the States hit by Sandy. LDS are always among the first to respond to disasters, because it is church policy to do so. They do not advertize it and prefer to help anonymously. Thousands of people found shelter at LDS chapels during Katrina. Come next Sunday when they pay their tithing and other offerings, you can bet that LDS all over the world will be contributing to the Sandy disaster fund, just like they have done for every other disaster for years,\r\n \r\n Do your research before you spout your mindless garbage about the LDS. Ask the Salvation Army and Catholic Charities who their biggest supplier of emergency supplies is. Ask Catholic Charities who devised the liquid meal formula for starving children and supplied it to them to distribute to the Ethiopians years ago and still does so. \r\nOtherwise STFU.

@ sonofa..............  ​ .... The Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Wednesday shows Mitt Romney attracting support from 49% of voters nationwide, while President Obama earns the vote from 47%. Two percent (2%) prefer some other candidate, and three percent (3%) remain undecided. This is the fifh consecutive day that Romney has been at the 50% level of support. He has enjoyed a three- or four-point edge on each of those days. No encumbent or challenger has ever lost the election having 50% or more in the polls going into the elections. \r\n  \r\nSwing state tracking: Romney 50% Obama 46%

The problem with writing an article about which shows to cancel is you have to pick shows that everyone has heard of. Therefore, their ratings are probably high enough to not warrant getting cancelled. This whole thing was an excuse to nitpick every dumb show on television... and there's a lot of dumb shows on television.

Reading over many of these comments, I'm beginning to think our education system is worse than I thought. Romney is a Morman. Obama is either a Christian or Muslim, depending who you ask. So what? Seriously, so what?  A candidates religion, legally and morally, is irrelevant. If you disagree with abortion and feel that Romney supports that view - and that's somehow the single most important issue to you in this election, then vote for Romney based on that. Who or what he does or doesn't worship should have NO bearing on your vote. You are supposed to vote for the person you feel will do the best job in running this country on ALL issues and one would hope the general public would be able to judge a person by their character and not what church they attend.

In this Romney can sound a lot more like a PR rep, then a world leader; not that politicians don't flip flop of course.  But in the PR industry it is considered a good business tactic, so long as it maintains a good corporate image, well deserved or not. \r\n  \r\nHis statements during that campaign might not put him much in agreement with all the Republican govenors however, when it's their own states that get hit by disaster.  As can be imagined, gov Christie would not want FEMA to be completely gone, and for there to be no assistance, right about now....

The argument is not whether Mormonism is a Christian religion. It is. ( I grew up Mormon). The real issue is that Mormons do not recognize other faiths. They consider them to be an abomination. That is what Mitt thinks of all of you who are not Mormons. Other Christian faiths are accepting of other denominations (as long as you are born again), but not Mormons.

Wonder how soon Darth Vader will show up on "Once Upon A Time"?? \r\n  \r\nLucas actually said in 1976 that he had planned 3 sets of trilogies.  But he said later on that only the 3 prequels would be made.  NOT the 3 sequels.  And other sites make it sound like Disney is planning an ongoing series of SWars movies.  Not just the 3.

Everybody has a choice - you have the right to believe in what you wish - but you don't have a right to force your beliefs on anyone else.  If you don't believe in abortion, don't have one - if you don't believe in gay marriage, don't marry a gay person - if you don't believe in using birth control, don't use it.  Just don't try to tell others their views are wrong because you don't agree with them.

I think that it is great that Trump is doing this because as a concerned citizen of this country I would like to know what President Obama is scared of as it relates to is passport and college records. If he is truly an American than what harm can there be in releasing these records for the entire country to see, plus if he releases them a charity of his choice would have $5M more to operate with over the next year(s). Oh I forgot one important thing if he releases his records and it shows he is not American that means everything he has sign into law or done as President is illegal and would have to be undone. So President Obama if you do not have anything to hide release this information without doctoring it to the public and then the news agencies need to release it without touching it up for the public to see, that way some charity will have $5M more in its bank account. All of the pro-President Obama people need to see 2016 Obama's America - it is really eye opening what we are in for and what this country will be like in 2016 if he is reelected as President.

First Marvel, now Star Wars, next THE WORLD. Will the government please stop this wanna-be monopoly from taking over all my childhood memories? When I think of my childhood, I think of Marvel, Star Wars, videogame companies like Sega and Nintendo, Disney and more but not where they are all ( speaking of Disney, SW and Marvel) under one money-hungry umbrella; they were all unique separate companies. What a catastrophe.  \r\n  \r\nAt least it would've been relatively better if Lucas just handed his company down to his children or someone else who truly shares his vision.  \r\n  \r\nR.I.P. Marvel and Star Wars \r\n(Disney, u shame the memory of Walt).

Even Ron Paul has dumped the repuke dunce party. He claims that they are "liars, cheaters and criminals".\r\n \r\nThis is great news. Gary Johnson may take away some of the Mexican Mormon Moron's votes. \r\nThis is great news for Obama. Ron Paul has "washed his hands" of the republican party after 30 years. He claims they are liars, cheats and criminals. His backers will probably not vote for lyin Willardo, the Mexican Mormon Moron tax evader, bankrupter, draft dodger, job outsourcer and Etch a Sketch Champion. This should easily allow Obama to win. His backers are considering drafting Gary Johnson, the former governor of New Mexico to run. \r\nJohnson, in my opinion, is too honest to win. He is truly, the only decent candidate the repuke freaks had, but they shut him out. Repukes - the party of voter supression. \r\n"The irony of the announcement by Congressman Paul is that it was the Republican party who first rejected him, long before Paul's decision to wash his hands of the GOP. During the primary campaign season, multiple Republican committees in states across the country used rule changes and local law enforcement to ensure the Texas Congressman did not succeed in winning primaries. Couple this with the fraudulent attempt to keep Ron Paul from being nominated at the Convention by stealing his delegates in Maine, and in other states, and it is no surprise that the soon to retire Congressman has had enough of the corrupt political party he supported for more than 30 years."

The election day is part of the constitution, and it could only be changed by an act of congress; we know that's not going to happen.\r\n \r\nMy personal opinion is to have the election next Tuesday as scheduled.

We need to go on and take care of business.

Only a republicscum would say something like that, and that's about as desperate as you can get. Simply pitiful. And this is the party everyone wants running this country. That's scary. You have a habitual liar as a candidate, a habitual liar as his running mate, and then a bunch of space cadets to round things off. Do you people hate this country that much? Or is it just because a white man isn't in office? If you don't like it here, just leave. I'm sure some other country would welcome you, as you would undoubtedly fit right in.

Not all these guys are roid boys. I'd be surprised if the guy in #2 ever touched them. One of the guys in #16 doesn't look like it either.

Putting Moore's and Soros's pathetic political ideals aside and all  this boils down to is a very sad exploitation of older people.  Older Americans (especially women) don't talk like gutter-mouthed rapper thugs. Abusing those suffering from dementia is not funny nor is it legal.  However, I suppose they were paid, so that absolves them of wrong-doing.  When you have nothing of substance to say, then you digress to using cheap shock ads in a desperate attempt to get attention and try to remain relevant.  This shows how weak they feel BOs chances really are.\r\n\r\nVOTE ROMNEY!!  He won't exploit your poor Granny and teach her swear words!

Trump is not donating because he is so nice and charitable. He is doing it to humiliate Obama, help the Republicans smear the Democrats, and also get a tax write off.

Really? Wasn't MLK a Christian? \r\n\r\nAnd are you a "true" Christian?  Then you support Obama who supports homosexuality which the Bible says in NO uncertain terms in BOTH the Old and the New Testament that it is  CAPITAL sin. \r\n\r\nYou support the killing of viable human babies through abortion which Obama also supports. Read God's dealing with Israel. One of central reason God judged and destroyed Israel in the most terrible way was because the practiced the religion of Chemosh. \r\n\r\nThe worship of Chemosh involved the burning alive on red hot steel alters new born babies. When God lists his reasons for judging Israel in a hideous manner, this constantly comes up in the prophets as one of the main reasons and it is pretty much the same as abortion.\r\n\r\nYou are not a real Christian and you know nothing about God. If you do not repent, God is quite capable of bringing the same kind of destruction in your life that he did with Israel. His mercy is available, but you cannot live in blasphemy and think that he will continue to allow it.

Haven't voted for a GOP candidate since about 1990, and I thought maybe the prayers and remorse I had sent to God before I became an atheist would have been enough to save my soul...but I guess not.

Anytime you switch what the goverment does to the private sector, you lose alot. Mostly because the private companies are there to make a PROFIT, which takes away from  monies aimed at fixing the problem at hand. The thing the republicans don't want you to realize is the federal goverment is for the PEOPLE, not the STOCKHOLDERS. Romney is good at making a profit for him and his partners, no matter what the cost to anyone else, thus BAIN enterprises. The federal goverment is not like it was in the 60's and 70's with so much waste as the republicans would have you believe, the news media in this instant answer climate expose that. But they do regulate people like Romney and his cronies when they try to rip us ALL off while saying they're helping us (aka. George W. Bulls___).

While I agree that this guy seems like an insensitive SOB, anyone can do the research and discover that it is not the democrats who are the most generous and caring people.  The figures show that Republicans give a much greater percentage of their pay than their Democratic counterparts.  My husband and I are Republicans and we donate 20% of our income to different charities and help causes.  I seriously doubt that any of the Democrats spewing their hate and venom on this site can say the same.

This an absolutely brilliant message for Christians who really believe in God and don't belong to some religious country club who stamp the name "Christian" on their organization.\r\n\r\nThere are going to be a lot of deceived Christians weeping before the Lord when they stand before him and try to explain their support of homosexuality, abortion and other blasphemies because they thought it was "cool" to vote for Obama. \r\n\r\nYour decisions will be tried by fire, make no mistake about it. In the New Testament it says, "be not deceived, God is not mocked. Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he reap...... he that sows to the flesh (lower nature or sin) will from sin reap destruction"  \r\n\r\nBoth the Old and New Testament describe homosexuality as a capital sin. \r\n\r\nIf you are caught in that sin, take heart, God will reach out to you with mercy - Christ died for your sins. But do not think that you can promote the gay lifestyle as a cause and be held innocent before God. God does not change his standards for sinners whether they are heterosexual or homosexual. \r\n\r\nNow before the gay rights attackers waste their time spewing hatred at this post. I won't be back to this article and I won't see what you write. I don't hate gays and I would be the first to defend someone if they were being bullied because they were gay. God loves gay people but he won't excuse their sin anymore than he will excuse adultery with heterosexuals.\r\n\r\nChrist forgave the women caught in the act of adultery and protected her from being stoned. However his parting words to her were, "Go and sin no more." In other words don't continue in your sin. \r\n\r\nIn God's love there is deliverance from any sin. God is there to help you if you just will ask for his help. God does love you

Mittens went as far to say that disaster relief should be contracted out.  That would be great.  Do you have money?  We'll save you.  The poor can die. Unless they can borrow money from their parents.

We are not prone to earthquakes, tornados or hurricanes where I live. We do have a friendly volcano that visits on occasion. I live on a flood plain that has not flooded in over 90 years. Storm drain systems and all prevention measures are in place. I am still required to buy flood insurance even though six inches of my garage is actually in the flood zone and FEMA wont take us off the flood zone list. Tell you the truth, I am tired of paying for the short sightedness of the states prone to hurricanes. I believe that once a community is destroyed by a hurricane they should not be allowed to rebuild in that area. This might be a hard stance and my heart felt thoughts go out to all who has suffered in this disaster but our leaders need to start making better decisions.

Had a parent tell me his daughter would be a great long jumper because she had long legs.  The girl was lazy, tough to coach and not very athletic.  Her 14'6" jump--small high school--didn't  put her in the top three and dad was ticked.  It was my fault, I didn't like the girl, she deserved to be on the team and on and on it went.   ---No death threats, so I guess it wasn't so bad.

If you are going to invoke what GOD is against and use that as a basis for your vote; then don't be selective about scripture and Christian values.  When did lying (not teling the truth or being a false witness) stop being a CHRISTIAN VIRTUE......so stop masking your political persuasion under the guise of Christianity.  I have never been so ashamed of so many Christians "forgiving" or should I say overlooking lying and then promoting it as a virtue.  There is no compassion in today's Christian.  It is unfortunate, but our nation is not a Christian nation, WE ARE A REPUBLIC who happened to use Christianity and other religious beliefs to create our laws.  We have freedom of RELIGION not freedom of Christianity!  So if you are going to be "value voter", then does lying count?  THINK ABOUT IT.

Not to worry, once the damage is assessed, the market will skyrocket. Lowe's, Home Depot, Georgia-Pacific construction wood... Rebuilding roadways, so look for ashpalt products to go up, same for gas and other petroleum products, there will be a much greater demand for the upcoming quarter. Only stocks I see dropping, should be insurance stocks, and only short term. Just be thankful that this storm didn't happen after January. You'd be screwed without FEMA bailing your @sses out. How exactly is a bankrupted state supposed to cover costs? Please think before voting.

Thank you Mitch Sea for standing up for God.  It frightens me and angers me to see how many people including Ministers and Christians have come to believe more in what the world says and less in what God has said.  It will be sad on the day they all find out the truth because by then it will be too late for them to change their ways.  I don't believe that Huckabee's ad is for everyone, it is meant for a reminder to Christians that we are to stand up for what God has said.  We have lost our saltiness too much.

He politicized the Keystone pipeline instead of enthusiastically embracing it...He and the rest of the liberal core screamed 8 years ago that ANWR would not be pumping oil for 5 years even if they approved a drilling bill...a place no one will ever visit....guess what? If we were even close to ready, it would lower the price by a conservative $1.00 a gallon...He has signed -0- new oil leases since becoming President...they are all old Bush leases...Do you know what this says to OPEC??? That and federal and state taxes are why we are reamed at the pumps.

I used to think it was attractive.  Now, i just think it's just plain dysfunctional.  While i would agree that you need the correct genetics to get huge, that can be overcome with chemicals and a great diet.  I would rather live steroid free and be healthy, than look huge on the outside but emotionally and internally be going to hell at the cellular level.  I guess age has a way of making you appreciate what god gave you.  I think its ironic that they use spray tans while they inject synthetic hormones that are not proven safe at the absurd levels are used at.  Some of them psychologically cannot go back to normal levels without depression because their whole body and image is based on a lie.

I think the president is desperate to look presidential and, since he failed miserably protecting Americans overseas, he is now over-reacting to draw support to his side.  Hope people are not fooled.  This last ditch effort in no way exponges his dismal performance as a president or hides his agenda to undermine what is left of this once great nation.

So we are to praise Obama for merely doing his job?   How about mentioning that Romney, his wife and campaign have been heavily involved in charity to aid those affected?  Guess that little tidbit escaped the media desperately trying to reelect Obama.

obama is not and never has been a Christian..  he belonged to a marxist and racist group call black liberation.. read the books of James H Cone.. it will give you an idea what it was about.. I doubt that Obama knows what a Christian is .. he is that far removed from anything that resembles Christianity.\r\nAnyone who has researched obama, as I have, knows that he only talks about Christianity just before an election and even then very briefly.. he just lets the word fly occasionally to give the impression that he might be one.. rest assured he is not.

Leprechaun.. then I suppose you don't blame him for the UE rate, gas prices, food prices, or anything else that he doesn't have direct control of.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that his policies helped to bolster the economy, and those corporate profits are a tangible representation of that.  A better method would be to compare domestic corporate profits growth rates to those in other countries.   According to the numbers at consensus economics, the US has done much better.  It shows that the environment for potential growth has been better in the US than in Japan, the UK, Canada, Germany, or Sweden.

Everything lyin Willardo feeds his braindead followers is a myth. I am sure he would be doing better if he told these repuke dopes that he would create 50 million jobs in the next 4 years. They don't need to be told how. \r\nClueless Lyin Willardo should not even be running for president. But for a lyin moron, talk is cheap. This clueless moron has no idea how to fix anything. This criminal repuke bankupts companies and loses jobs. What a joke. The nuts that follow him actually believe that he is going to create 12 million new jobs and these dopes believe him. He does not have to tell them how, that does not matter. \r\nClueless Lyin Willardo is known as the slapped axx Mexican Mormon Moron for good reason. This complete dunce made himself look even more ignorant than he already is by stating in a campaign clip that if he ever overpaid his taxes, he does not deserve to be your president. Well this repuke dunce overpaid his 2011 taxes by $3,000 to make it look like he was paying a higher tax rate-which he can recover after the election. He has up to 3 years to refile an amended return. Only a pathetic, psychotic, braindead radical right wing cracked teanut dope will vote for him.

Silly you, misinformed you.  Mormons ARE Christians.  They believe in the Bible, and they love the Lord Jesus Christ.  Ask one what he believes, not some mixed up propaganda you've read by one who really doesn't know of what he speaks.   We should all have such high standards, work ethics, service oriented lives as these wonderful people.  I wouldn't think you would find one of them ever belitteling another's faith or telling them what they THINK they believe.

Had Obama commuted this guys sentence and he killed you would want the buck to stop with Obama. Could Obama read tea leaves that  our embassy would be attacked, no, but he was in charge and therefore must accept responsibility. Huck assisted in the murders because he was the where the buck stopped. He could have said no. \r\nHe let a man with a known DUI history out of jail that ended up drunk driving, crossing the center line into an oncoming car that was a police car.  These folks are in jail for a reason the courts and a jury decided was sufficient, a gov should not be allowed to unilaterally over rule a judge and jury. If he does then he at fault if it goes wrong. He did not need tea leaves, he had a juries conviction and evidence to look into.

I've always found it interesting that if this were some Imam from Iran, instead of a Christian from the U.S. it would make headlines.  \r\n  \r\nFundamentlism of ANY sort can be dangerous if it gets out of the realm of religion and into politics. \r\n  \r\nThe U.S., despite what many people seem to think was not designed as a "Christian" nation.

He is so full of bull-its pathetic.\r\nI really wish he would offer ROMNEY 5 million to show his tax returns.\r\n \r\nTrump wants attention during the election-makes him feel like he is running for something-lol  like a$$hole of a lifetime!! \r\nSomehow he got this notion that he is better then everyone and can BULLY anyone. He is a real class act--NOT \r\nI've been to "TRUMP" towers in Las Vegas-its nothing to write home about-in fact their are far nicer hotels in Vegas-his is sub par compared to the rest.\r\nHe is a liar, a cheat (we know he cheated on 2 of his wives) an airhead,a bigot,and a racist,etc.etc.\r\n  The "Donald" has never did anything for the people of New York or New Jersey-or any another part of the country-except take up air...\r\nI have lost all respect for him over the last 4 years now I think of him as just a FUC*ING A$$HOLE!!\r\nIF he has so much money that he can try and bribe people-he should give it to charity-but then he gets no satisfaction out of that.

I think whatever causes the animal the least amount of pain. Like you said quick and easy. Medication would be poisonous to meat eaters and gas would be painful.  \r\n Quick, simple without being put through a plant or slaughterhouse.  \r\n How they used to do it way back in the day.  \r\n Now they beat, break, force-feed, its horrible.  \r\n Anyway that's why I buy milk/cheese from the local farmers. I think meat should be bought locally too.

I couldn't find much on this guy's judicial record, but just because he was appointed by a Republican doesn't mean that the Republicans are somehow universally to blame.\r\n \r\n1. Not all Bush appointees are created equal. Justice Roberts was a key vote in upholding the Obama healthcare bill, for example.\r\n \r\n2. I think it's pretty safe to say that most conservatives and liberals alike are opposed to this kind of intrusion of personal rights. This was just one judge who made a bad decision. You can't sterotype an entire group of people because of it.

To be serious, I think it's because intelligent people think more about the serious things in life....the depressing things....the fact that our world is going to hell in a handbasket, etc.  The things that the, no offense, duller among us may not notice or care about, we can't help but analyze and come to the all too depressing conclusions on.  Then we drink to cope.....oh and to deal with the unwashed masses of idiotic people we have to deal with day in and day out.  Absolutely because we have to deal with those MORONS.

First I'd like to send good vibes to all NYC Witnesses and anybody else affected by Sandy. \r\n  \r\nSecond, I went to see Saint Etienne last night and really liked it.  They don't knock you over the head with their meldodies and arrangements.  They're too smart for that.  17 songs over 80 minutes with nary a duff cut.  And yes, Sarah is captivating.  Plus I now have a new appreciation for both Sylvie and Like A Motorway.  I will note that six (rather than three per Bob's NYC review) new songs were played--Popular, Haunted Jukebox, When I Was Seventeen, Tonight, DJ and I've Got Your Music--and the setlist has been essentially the same since this tour started. \r\n  \r\nSo if you have an opportunity to catch 'em on the west coast I say go for it.

I agree with the father and the Judge, she married him under false pretense - she should have told him she was ugly and spent monies to improve her looks and maybe her body.  It is basically the same as the ladies fake hair and nails.  When they take off these portables most of them are really ugly!!!  Had she told him, he perhaps would have been more forgiving and understanding.
1
Mike Huckabee should quit playng God and let God make the decisions on who goes to hell or to heaven.  I am tired of these politicians and so called religious people saying that we must bow to their wishes because they know what God wants.\r\n \r\nGod has the final judgment and not any man on earth, not even the Pope.  \r\n \r\nPeople who force others to follow their beliefs are sinners in many ways.  If we let the religious run our nation, we will go back thousands of years living in fear and degradation.  When the religious lead, tolerance dies.

Its funny how people are criticizing  Romney for doing a good thing he cant get donations and food for people impacted by the storm in those areas he has to get them else where. He turned a political event into a charity event to help those in need yet you guys give him crap about it . Also there is a good point to compare how he is acting this time over how he acted when Americans where killed this 9-11. He finally did his job for once where last time he was more concerned with not telling us whats going on and going to Vegas to get donations for his campaign. An we dont have to respect him or anything unless he has earned it, and over the past 4 years he has not earned the respect from me and all the other people not blinded by his lies. An if you question that then you, your self are blind and a fool, cuaz i didn't fight over in Iraq to watch this Amazing country go down the drain any further then it already has under Obama. \r\n\r\nSo Vote Romney, Vote for your self. But dont Vote Blindly for lies and unkept promises!

Nope, life has to go on, unfortunately so does politics.

Take away Washington's money (actually our money). Then the politicians can babble, plot, scheme, and cheat among themselves, but it won't have that much effect. Take away their power to tax so we can all live in peace and not be subjected to their "isms". The income tax started out as a miniscule tax attached to a tariff bill, and the politicians have turned it into the worlds most colossal debt. The income tax didn't work; scrap it.

Dr. Nobrains,\r\n\r\nHow did the U.S. survive all the natural disasters before FEMA for the last 200 years? Tell me why you need FEMA and why the local government and the State can't do for themselves? Please elaborate? By the Way, your true care President took $750 Billion dollars from our senior's medicare to fund and condition you on Obamacare with 18 taxes just for you and all the middle class. Your true care President also doubled our deficit in half the time it took GWB. Your true care President swore & promised NOT to raise taxes on anyone, EVER during his term as President during the 2008 campaign. Your true care President helps energy independent Brazil & Colombia with oil subsidies to drill in the gulf but won't let OUR American companies do the same. Your true care President has closed over 200 coal mines in economic deprived areas of West Virginia, Ohio & Pennsylvania stripping these people of their only source of income and employment. Your true care President won't act or sign the "keystone" pipeline with Canada to help secure energy independence or help create thousands of American jobs right now. Your true care President bailed out Wall Street at the expense of Main Street by adding to our deficit, wasting tax payer dollars on failed stimulus programs like 'clash for clunkers', 'shovel ready jobs' and billions on 'green energy' projects. Your true care President won't enforce to stop illegal immigration that is costing us jobs for Americans and adding to our healthcare costs which are paid by the American tax payers. Your true care President let 4 Americans get slaughtered in Libya without providing and then denying added security measures then watched and didn't do a damn thing. Your true care President has put over 43 million Americans on food stamps. Your true care President has had unemployment over 8% for over 40 months and has done nothing to help fix it except create more government jobs. The fact of the matter is your 'TRUE CARE' comment is an oxymoron. This President hasn't truly cared about anything except the expansion and scope of government dependency, anti-business, anti-capitalism, and anti-free market. I don't know what kind of doctor you are but I'm certainly glad you're not mine!

"Send Emergency Support Duties to the States but even better send it to the Private Sector"  Mitt Romney. \r\n In other words the water trucks would roll in and you could buy some.

erm....I have to disagree. A lot. The content and storyline were epically terrible.\r\n \r\nEpisode1: A 6 year old super genius falls in love with a 16 year old queen, and we're not supposed to be creeped out knowing that they eventually have kids together. Jar-Jar Binks...need I say more? Anakin makes C3P0 which is never again discussed. The force is an STD, not a religon....this alone ruined Star Wars and everything it ever stood for. There is nothing "good" about this movie, even if it was a standalone movie, it would still be sh!t.\r\n \r\nEpisode 2: All stormtroopers are now just clones of Bobba Fett, which takes away ALL the consequences, humanity, and years of discussion about if it was wrong to blow up the Death Star with thousands of people on board (See Clerks for a better explanation of this). Somehow Anakin managed to age 15 years while Amadala stayed the same age, which makes their sex a little less creepy but screws up the continuity of the story. Jar-Jar helps create the Empire by backing Palpatine and giving him the power to become the Emporer. This movie is almost passable, if you exlude everything I just stated above.\r\n \r\nEpisode 3: The only decent movie of the bunch, with the glaring exception of Darth Vader going all Frankenstein on us at the end. That entire scene was literally lifted directly form the pages of Mary Shelly's famous novel, the only thing missing was the doctor yelling "It's Alive!!! It's Alive!!!"\r\n \r\nAll in all these movies serve to totally take away anything that was ever "cool" or interesting about the original trilogy. Take away the Force, the evil Empire's humanity,\r\nthe balls of the movie because Lucas wanted it to be more "kid friendly", and what you are left with is exactly what we got, a huge steaming pile of a childrens movie which oddly has a lot of heady political idealogy and discussion, and a WAY too many cartoon aliens thrown in to distract you from the fact that....man....these  ​  movies blow.

Whether I agree with Huckabee or not, I respect his right to voice his opinion as opposed to the many uneducated idiots who write with such hatred.  Query if any of them finished high school?  Of course, their opinion must be tolerated because it is the only valid one...obviously, there can't be an opinion of a differing nature.

Why should anyone be surprised as this has happen many times before. The question remains two, why are the voting in the public hands with the judges voteing for the best job and the fans voting for who flips their lid that night. Next is,Why do the judges vote for the the best job done if it is a contest for Americas dancing star? Either cut the voting by the judges or the public.

Sofia Vergara has the best sense of humor.   She is a class act.   When Julie Bowen won the Emmy, Sofia was very gracious about it.   In a business full of egos, Julie Bowen and Sofia Vergara are very close and supportive of each other.  I think some of the funniest moments on Modern Family are when Sofia and Julie are together.   They are the female versions of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau.   They are hilarious together.

Believers have little use for education....they must merely believe. No amount of facts about the candidates will matter. They will believe what they want...whatever fits their world view and doesn't challenge their current beliefs. It's similar to how mentally ill people cope with trauma. It's as ridiculous as it is frustrating...but don't dare call it for what it is or you might offend someone or cause someone to threaten you with physical bodily harm or death for being an infidel.\r\n\r\nThere's a reason we have separation of church and state in this country. Many believers will tell you that no such thing exists and attempt intellectual contortions in their interpretation of the Constitution that would leave Gumby paralyzed from the waist down. Belief is all it takes to negate reality, it seems.

I would love to see them re-introduce Charlie Sheen (sober) to Two and 1/2 Men because Ashton Kutcher just isn't a good fit, and all of the great scripts have gone totally stupid and nonsensical since his introduction. The pre-occupation with his alleged good looks have over shadowed the excellent cast and scripts of the past. I am afraid when Charlie and the producer played hardball with each other they created a Lose/Lose situation for all of the shows dedicated fans!  I assume the previous writers quit with Charlie, because the scripts have been horrendous, and like Charlie or not, that show was written for him, and Kutcher pales by comparison!

The “thumpers” are often the ones seeking their own glory instead of listening to Christ.  If you are going to follow Christ as an example or anyone for that matter you need to do what they did.  Christ was slow to judge and quick to show compassion.  Seriously the opposite of these angry-judgmental doomsday criers.  However, the press sure does love them for making a mockery of Christians.  When was the last time you saw an article with someone truly being Christ-like?

Yes. And if America had any sense they would legalize it, regulate it and get revenue from it. The war on drugs is a dismal failure. Just look at how alcohol prohibition failed.

Churches are tax exempt, get tax free donations and federal assistance money. I don't. Where is the seperation in that? And don't give me that non-profit crap.

Why are so many people jumping on each other about which race-black or white-has made the most false accusations against someone of the opposite race?  This is a tragic thing, that it happens at all.  Why does it matter if one race does it more?  Isn't ANY racism a bad thing?  Aren't we just perpetuating the whole thing by comparing the two races and trying to see which is better or worse than the other?  How will we ever get rid of racism until we stop comparing and just learn to live with each other as human beings?

Actually , we're not being duped because we are not voting for Romney. Also we are not "stupid" because,  we are not voting for Romney. Once again Mr. Romney did not evolve as a candidate he revolved. He has revolved so many times he is too dizzy  to remember what he says from one day to the next. "I'm not sure what I said but whatever it was, I stand by it" ( Romney quote)  If that were true, it would be the first time.

5 years!!! For what?? Are you nuts? You must really think prison is some big joke don't you? It's people like you who are absolutely ruining this country, sending people to prison for extremely long sentences for basically minor offences. I am SOOO sick of you and your goody two shoe'd kind, who run and hide behind the police when EVER anything goes wrong. In fact, I bet your the kind of person who'd call the police for seeing a "suspicious" person walking down your alley or sidewalk. Or call the police on someone who's double parked, or in a handicapped spot without a sticker. In fact I bet you call the police once a year, just so they don't forget about you. You want to let them know that your out there, fighting the "good fight" right along with them. To let them know that they can depend on you to tattle on "criminals" if there are no cops around when a double parker is present.\r\nAnd the funny thing is, I bet you and the snitches like you, think that the police actually like you. That they think of you as one of their own, when the truth is they think your a low life puss yourself who has ZERO friends but counts the whole police department as one. Do you know what the police call their snitches behind their backs? RATS. Yup thats right, even the "good guys' don't have any respect for them... So the next time your doing the polices' job for them, being a tattle tale on your neighbor, just know this; Even the police think your a low life scum bag...

Michael Brown, Brownie, geez, dude, or more aptly, dud. It's a good thing, maybe even good leadership, although IMHO politically motivated that resources were put online BEFORE the actual catastrophe struck. Naturally, Brownie, by your words, you would have waited until AFTER the catastrophe, then brought needed resources to bear. FOOLISH, to wait until after ! How would desperately required assets be brought to bear AFTER the roads are inundated?  DA, its far far far better to be proactive than reactive. Being proactive saved man hours to get needed assets to the areas affected. Being proactive saved lives. Being proactive lessened needless suffering. Brownie strikes me as one whom would not get out of the way of Grandma using a walker. When a disaster or other catastrophe is nigh, get out if you can, or prepare the best you can. I will be bluntly frank...Brownie, you are a DOLT !

I have seen all six movies and read several novel series based on the characters. My gripe with Lucas was he contradicted the fate of Padme in Revenge of the Sith with her fate as stated in Return of the Jedi. The story line can go well beyond episode six, in literature we know that Luke has a son and  his family continues. The Sith go back thousands of years before The Phantom Menace. In the latest nine volume series Luke & his son Ben discover a whole tribe of Sith.  Han and Leia have a granddaughter destined to become the Queen of the Jedi. Lots of possibilities for more movies. I hope the new movies show Luke's wife Mara and their son.

(Reuters) - Ally Financial Inc, the U.S. auto lender 74 percent owned by the U.S. government, on Wednesday said it has repaid $2.9 billion in debt issued under a financial-crisis-era  ​  program designed to bolster confidence in the banking system.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe debt, issued on Oct 30, 2009, came due on Tuesday. The lender plans to repay the remaining $4.5 billion in debt it issued under the program in December.\r\n\r\n\r\nLook, folks, I am not in love with the banks either, after what they did to us, however, this entire\r\nargument about (1) Obama getting us into debt, (2) the banks got 'free money' and (3) the government never made a profit are all BUNK!   Give it a rest...\r\nSend blood and donations to the Red Cross instead of posting today.

yeah...um....no. If you can be a functional alcoholic, then more power to you. Personally, i don't drink that much because i know i could easily become an alcoholic, and i've had friends (former) just live that lifestyle hard enough to be dead or have near death health issues. So even though this might be true, moderation is the key. If you drink from 10am to midnight, everyday, it will kill you and make people around you miserable until you are dead. Then it won't matter anymore. Cheers!

I've studied many religions, Mormon, and all forms of Christian denominations.   You can say what you wish. but they have distinct and very different views from the 'evangelical' christians.- which I believe is what Huckabee is.\r\nI'm not saying Mormonism is wrong or right.. I'm saying that the majority of christians are under the wrong impression of what Romney's faith stands for - if  they are basing their votes on a president's faith.  WHICH THEY SHOULDN'T ANYWAY... Whoever takes on the office of President SHOULD NOT  and WOULD NOT run this country based on religious beliefs but what is right for all Americans in this nation.\r\nP.S.  Huckabee and all preachers should keep government OUT of their speeches.

No, this is quite the opposite from what I see.  Smart people tend to have more self discipline and understand cause and effect better than the average person.  It’s the idiots that act like fools, breed like wild animals and spend more on their toys than their kids education that tend to have mountains of beer cans piling up around them.  \r\n  \r\nWhats next?  Eating cake makes you skinny.

It wasn't a threat that he held over people's heads. It was a promise he made to keep people safe and to see that those who enjoy Halloween weren't deprived. It wasn't just a good call; it was the right call. Lincoln reintroduced Thanksgiving to give a nation at war something to celebrate - this is the same thing on a smaller scale.

Only in this country could the lyin Mexican Mormon Moron have such high poll numbers, although still losing. Only the braindead repuke dopes here can't see the light. \r\nHONG KONG — If the rest of the world got to vote, President Obama apparently would be re-elected in a landslide. \r\nA new survey of global opinions for the BBC World Service shows 20 of 21 countries favoring Mr. Obama. France, Australia, Canada, Nigeria and Britain went most heavily for Obama. \r\nThe only country surveyed with a Mitt Romney yard sign on its lawn was Pakistan, which favored the Republican challenger by 14 percent to 11 percent. (Three-fourths of Pakistani respondents had no preference.) \r\nElsewhere in Asia, Chinese respondents preferred Mr. Obama, 28 percent to 9 percent, as did South Koreans (58 to 9); Japanese (33 to 9); Indians (36 to 12); and Malaysians (28 to 13).
1
No Obama did the right thing he saved lives and helped the people get out of the cities that were impacted so hard.  Brownie did a heckuva job watching people waiting for water and food to arrive a little too late.  He is a hypocrite to even make a comment after the way the Bush Administrations actions were a disgrace to the USA and the people that were caught in Katrina.  He should go under a rock and hide his face instead of making any comment on President Obama, a person with a real heart and truly cares about people.

That's all fine and dandy, what happens when your employer cuts all your medical and 401K benefits out in order to "Help keep your Job"?  After the great Market crash of 2008 my  401K fell even more after hostile rollovers fees and charges. Then I managed to start building it back up only to learn my employer is dumping all my benefits at the end of the month and all I can do is another costly rollover..or cash out which is even more devastating.  Retirement has become nothing more then a cruel joke and I am not laughing.

Emily, you are out of touch. This advice might be better served for emerging China or India. As Americans we are about to see a huge change where no one but executives will have to worry about 401(k)s and vesting. Your advice should be to buy precious metals and invest in global stocks. I see no mention of the pending devaluation of the US currency, which is really the problem with our retirement plans. What is $1 Million is lifetime savings worth when the dollar is useless as a global currency? Have you not seen zimbabwe lately... \r\n  \r\nSo while the rest of the executives continue to sell short in US stocks, we are supposed to buy all-in. Who is paying you? It is about time you come clean with your pupet master, enough of this, I am buying gold and silver and nothing else.

The comments below the ad are shocking -  why do so many people not understand? The Bible is clear that God is truth and  love, He loves and knows each of the unborn and all of you despite yourselves.  Those of you who are so loved must be asked how, if you care about anyone other than yourselves, you can even consider voting for former Illinois Senator Obama who argued (check the record if you doubt this please) that babies born alive during failed abortions can be left to die? If we don't speak up for these defenseless blessed little ones, who will?  Do you not hear their cries for mercy? Think of this - if a baby is a few days, a few weeks, a few months, or even a few years old, and you then discover was the result of a rape or incest, are you then going to kill that child? Why? What did this child do wrong?  This child is also a child of the mother while there are so many childless couples praying for children to love and who will honor those little lives.  Why not choose life rather than killing your own beautiful baby by abortion? At least learn the truth as I cannot think of a more selfish action than to kill your own child, can you?

Actually, I was one of the first boots on the ground and stayed through Rita. I worked 20 hours a day doing roving patrols and delivering ice and food to the residents. There were stations everywhere to pick up food and supplies. After as few days, they were running out of room for all the volunteers flooding in to help. I am sure it felt like it took forever to get help, but really no need to bash others that have been affected.

I believe it is the woman who decides to abort or not to abort.  She is the one to deal with her decision for the rest of her life.  No man should ever have the right to decide what a woman does with her body. I agree with TabbyK that we should vote for the person that will take care and lead our country.  Personal matters should never be invovled in political matters.  With the marriage controversy, I can only side with a vet who said that a fellow serviceperson saved his life & who was good enough to service this country, should be good enough to marry whomever they have love for.

Great idea, let people build homes at taxpayer based 'insurance' right on the coast lines, that we rebuild at "our" expense.  Great idea, lets rebuild the ninth ward and all of St. Bernard Parish in New Orleans when it was natures buffer to keep New Orleans from flooding.  Great idea, lets let the "government" be responsible for re-building homes on cliffs hanging over rivers and oceans, that "we" pay for when they fall off their perches.

So, our country supposedly prides itself on FREEDOMS.  One of those is Freedom of Religion.  But if your religious beliefs dictate voting for one candidate over the other, you're an embarrassment, or a political tool?  \r\n And liberals who vote for the other candidate simply because he says anything goes, and doesn't stand up for his "Alleged" religious beliefs, are morally superior how?

Fake Christians like this idiot seem to forget what Jesus said:  Give onto Cesar what belongs to Cesar and to God what belongs to God.   God only goes by your personal thoughts and actions so if you believe that he would not agree with abortion, then don't abort and you will not be comitting a sin - as simple as that!   And has he forgotten what he said about rich people?  Especially rich people who became rich by ruining poor people?

Silly you, misinformed you.  Mormons ARE Christians.  They believe in the Bible, and they love the Lord Jesus Christ.  Ask one what he believes, not some mixed up propaganda you've read by one who really doesn't know of what he speaks.   We should all have such high standards, work ethics, service oriented lives as these wonderful people.  I wouldn't think you would find one of them ever belitteling another's faith or telling them what they THINK they believe.

So not a word about Michael Moore putting out a add telling Democrats to burn this country down if Romney s voted in but yell to the high heavens if Christians are asked to vote by their beliefs. But then coming from MSN I should not be surprised.\r\n \r\nAs for calling Obama a Christian, the bible states 'by their works you will know them', so far all I have seen is a wolf in sheep clothing that has forced Churches to go against their beliefs, selfishly putting our children in an unbearable debt by putting a debt on their shoulders with no concern about tomorrow, and then nothing but divisiveness, lies and attacks during this campaign instead of showing any positions.\r\n \r\n“If an administration has a bad record and nothing to stand on, they will turn to attacks and divisiveness to turn Americans heads away from the truth", Barak Obama 2008.

Back to the original post.  it has nothing to do with Mormon vs Christian.  It has to do with there values and how they will represent them.  Not to start an argument, but the 600lb gorilla in the room being abortion.  Mit is against while Obama is for it (with in reason).  So Hucks argument is for people to base there vote on who best represents there moral fiber and to remember they will eventually be judged by that choice.  Will they in fact be judged? I don’t know, no one knows, but the msg isn’t really "that bad" and definitely has nothing to do with each opponents standing religion.

Of course he was, that's silly. He postponed trick or treat. Where I live trick or treat is never on Halloween anyway. I think that he is both right and wrong about the election issue. I think someone should be thinking about the election problems but he and the people in his state should be able to focus on recovery. However, if the elections are not addressed I think we can expect to see election results challenged at all levels for those areas, and I think those results should be challenged in that situation.

Most of the east coast and Sabrina's fans did not even get to see the show or vote because of the storm.  If she had gotten her New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Rhode Island, Connecticut, North Carolina, Virginia, and all the other states without power or got affected by the big "Sandy" storm votes, she would still be here.  That was not fair.  I am a big fan, and I lost power Monday and part of Tuesday, so I never got to see her dance.  They should not have had an elimination this week because of the storm, not next week.

Lucas is finished and that is old news people.  A great man who was never satisfied with the awesome stories he brought to the big screen.  Episodes one, two, and three were bittersweet for many fans.  They loved new star wars (ironically actually old or first) but they hated the fact that his story telling became cliche and almost a caricature of his original vision.  \r\n\r\nDisney is an evil beast, anyone worth that much money is inherently evil and they want to take over the world in terms of entertainment.  Surely not Walt's original idea.  Money grubbing people have taken over now though so whatever.\r\n\r\nI hope if they make a new story line they bring back Mark, Carrie, and Harrison.  I always wanted to see a new story line with the original characters from the first 3 films.  That was part of the problem with the prequels.  Nobody cared about the characters.  It was interesting to see their origins but nobody ever connected with them on the level they did with the original 3 films.  \r\n\r\nHow much money do you need Lucas?  Tell you what...I live in modesto and I am a struggling artist.  Can you spare about 6 million dollars?  I will make it back to you 3 times over within 7 years.  I will be better.....stronger.  ​ ...faster. \r\n\r\nLet me know George,\r\n\r\nYou are my only hope.....

Huckabees issues?  Abortion?  Same sex marriage?  The God Huckabee claims to know gives us all free will (choice).  However, some people think they can force their will on others in this culture.  Yet they are blind to 'the root of all evil' according to God's Word. And that is the Love of Money.  To be so passionate about conception & so lacking in Romney's life principles.  Buy a company & bankrupt it for profit, or relocate it overseas for profit. Both at the expense of people losing jobs here,(many with families). Is that the kind of man and respecter of life beyond the womb that we should vote for to score points with God?

I give quite often.   I gave week before last, and will give again the first week of December.    Mine is 0 negative, and I was told that most often, mine is used for infants that need transfusions, so I'm more than happy to spend an hour or so to go do that every few months.  It's a really easy way to help someone out who's life may well depend on it.

I like this show because I'm fascinated by what the human mind does to comfort itself.  All of these people suffered tragedies and coped by hoarding.  I enjoy seeing them pull themselves out of it, with help.  This season is getting kind of off track though with the "Matt wants to see what it's like to live like a Hoarder, so he's spending the night amongst the rat droppings and roaches!".  It's just too much.  Also - what's up with the annoying hard rock guitar music when they show the mess?  Like the pictures aren't jarring enough.  I say keep the show - lose the slumber party with the pests and the annoying music!

Just a reminder that one of the many adverse agenda investments of Bain Capital was the robo-signing away of our homes. His offshore bank account managed business had security interests in housing. Instead of finding out IF there were actual files for these... he contracted out to law firms to repossess them. It's a FACT that over half of our home mortgages were done without diligence. Diligence and documents being REQUIRED in order to foreclose. All done illegally AND with profits going offshore to evade taxes.\r\n \r\nA vote for Romney is an anti-American vote. Let's re-elect Obama and give him support in Congress so we can make progress.

Romney in that debate said funding FEMA was "immoral" and we couldn't spend that kind of money at the Federal level. He said the States could handle it much better themselves (without any Federal aid).\r\n\r\nThis is actually very consistent with his reaction to GM going under. His idea was they could look for private equity. I guess instead of Federally insured loans to help people rebuild, he would rather they secured private financing at whatever rates they could get.

When you hear what officials in Manhattan say about the advanced warning, it makes this guy look like the idiot he is. It's been a blessing, according to these officials, that they were able to have time to "power down" the subways and the equipment to avoid total ruination of this part of the infrastructure. They have said that if they had not had the time to do this, the damage would have been billions of dollars more and certainly more lives would have been lost. They shut operations down prior to the storm hitting. This was the very best scenario given what was coming. So this clown is just trying (and I know it's not easy) to find something negative to say about a job well done up to this point by President Obama, FEMA, yes, the federal government. Way to go, guys, and we're proud to have you on our side.

First off, Separation of Church and state does not mean what you think it does.  It was written in to our constitution so that the government would not be able to tell a person how to believe or what to believe.  Not for the church to not be able to have a say in government.  Our government was based on Judeao Christian Beliefs and all of our founding fathers had faith in God.   Second, I don't know where you get your information but churches do not get federal money.  Churches get their money from their congregations tithing as God has called us to do.  Churches are not in it for profit and if you actually went to church you would know that most churches are hurting to keep going because of our economy.  Yes there are a few Mega-churches that have money and seem to be making a profit but most churches money goes to everything that a business would pay for...salaries, lighting, heating, water and then the rest goes to programs supporting food banks and missions and also to areas hit by storms such as this country has just had.

I thnk Huckabee should get down on his knees and beg forgiveness for commiting  the sin of  pretending to act for God.'  He has no right to say what God will do, nor does he know Romeny's heart when it comes to the issues Huckabee gets all in a sweat about.  Romney has changed sides so many times no one , not even the great Huckabee, can claim he is God's favorite.   Marriage isn't a religous issue unless the peolple want it consecrated in a church. Otherwise it is a civil,and legal contract between the persons involved.  Life from conception is a tough one, when is a person's soul installed?  For instance, if personhood were law, a woman couldn't be saved from a tubal pregnancy because it would destroy the possible child..It would be murder.and the doctor would be the murderer.  Huckabee should "judge not".

In the past, Our Great Nation was blessed by GOD because we were founded on and maintained Biblical morals and values. This is no longer the case as this nation now promotes and allows the killing of innocent babies (as did Pharaoh of Egypt and King Herod who was attempting to kill The Christ Child) and embraces homosexuality (the very reason GOD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah). These two acts of mankind (abortion and homosexuality) are among the most DETESTABLE ABOMINATIONS AGAINST GOD! Anyone who believes that GOD will bless this nation while we allow these ABOMINATIONS AGAINST GOD to continue is simply ignorant of THE TRUE WORD OF GOD (The Bible).  \r\n“Christian” means = “CHRIST like”. JESUS CHRIST IS THE TRUE WORD OF GOD (The Bible)….. \r\nJOHN 1:14 “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.” \r\nPROVERBS 29:26 Many seek the ruler’s (political leaders) favour; But every man’s judgment cometh from the LORD. \r\nDEUTRONOMY 28:45 Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep His commandments and His statutes which He commanded thee: JAMES 4:4 Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world (politically correct) is the enemy of God. II JOHN verse 9 Whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. II JOHN verse 10 If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine (THE TRUE WORD OF GOD,The Bible), receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed: II JOHN verse 11 For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds. \r\nDid you hear THE TRUE WORD OF GOD? A True Christian will not even wish “God speed” to a politician who is in favor of abortion and homosexuality rights, let alone vote for that politician! Any self proclaimed Christian or anyone else who desires to be “a friend of the world” (politically correct) when it comes to abortion and homosexuality rights “is an enemy of GOD” and is not being Christ like (Christian) at all!  Anyone who votes for or supports in any way a politician who is against or opposes THE WORD OF GOD “in even one point” (this includes abortion and homosexuality), is a “partaker of ALL of his evil deeds” and in THE EYES OF GOD is “guilty” of performing every abortion and every homosexual act! \r\nJAMES 2:10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. \r\nAccording to THE TRUE WORD OF GOD WHO IS JESUS CHRIST: Mike Huckabee is RIGHT!

No , I dont think they were insensitive. First off he says that  forcible rape is inexcusable and  indefensible. I do understand that rape, having known and loved people who have experienced this is a terrible  thing for anyone to endure.  There are many great people that were  born as the resort of someone being raped  or taken advantage of . Because the life of a living human  is precious  and  I  believe that sometimes God hides his richest treasures in those who enter the world   broken or through sorrowful or painful situations.  He is the same God who said that his strength was made perfect in our weakness and that he purposely chooses those who seem of ignoble birth to put to shame those who  are of noble birth.  The other thing is I have heard women say of abortion that  they have this ache that never leaves.  Life is sometimes very painful but God is Good and can help us through anything if we look to him and rely on his mercy and grace.

I got my information by comparing the profile of God, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit as contained in the Bible, to the profile of the same as contained in the Book Of Mormon... and comparing doctrine in the Bible to 'doctrine' found in The Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl Of Great Price.\r\n \r\nThe profiles do not line up = not the same God, Jesus Christ or Holy Spirit = imposters = blasphemy!  And you KNOW the doctrine couldn't be any more different = blasphemy!  \r\n \r\nCheck out saints alive . com if you still don't understand.  There is absolutely NO NEED for 'another testiment' of Jesus Christ.  The original is quite enough!

Please just leave star wars alone. If Disney creates star wars movies then there will be more Jar Jar type characters and everything will be geared towards kids. If people really look at the first star wars movie created, it was geared toward adults and THAT is what drew people in. We have enough kid flicks. Leave star wars for adults.

yeh yu notice these kinds of intrusions are only happening in rpublican run states and they are the ones wh are claiming less goverment. now i c how they want to do it they will just place camera's in everyones homes now sp they can layoff police and just convist people right outof their homes. If you vote for Republicans this is your near futre get used to it. Wisconsin is a republican run state by Scott who has already layed off police, firemen. teachers and closed down govt union and rights

Once again, buddadon, you miss the point.  All i am saying is that, in light of the abuses that occurred after Katrina it is possible that abuses will occur after Sandy.  Instead of throwing pre-loaded credit cards at everyone get more info so that those in REAL need get the help instead of the creeps.

Pastor Don, The Holy Spirit resides in born again believers of Jesus Christ as God's seal on their life. The Holy Spirit in the world points people to Jesus and attests to the Word of God. God hates the shedding of innocent blood according to His word. He calls homosexuality an abomination. It'd time to be bold for Jesus in these Last Day's instead of pandering to the world.  It's a clear choice: either vote for a life candidate or a death candidate for the unborn. It is important to God.

This comment by Brownie is the idiotic. The president was trying to and likely did save lives. There could have and would have been thousands or at least hundreds more dead if he had waited longer as Brownie suggest. Brownie did a terrible job during the  Katrina hurricane and is the last person to comment on proper disaster preparations or response. I really dislike it when republicans use deaths and pain and suffering for political purposes. The country should get behind Obama in these times of turmoil and not play stupid political word games. But then Obama is a commander in chief and not a partisan hack like the incompetent Brownie.

Who does this fat clown think he is ? Look at him in his monogrammed fleece declaring that as governor he will declare that Oct 31 will be next week. Halloween is Oct. 31. Just because you were elected to public office, you can not decide when holidays are celebrated. Halloween is the last day in Oct. If you think that the conditions are not safe right now you can move trick or treating till next week, but you can't change the dates holidays are. So get your fat **** from in front of the cameras and help the people of your state. If you had spent less time making speeches and more time preparing your state. The people having trouble would have been less.

No, not in the least as this will go down as a storm of historic propotions.  Actually he is doing his job and doing it very well unlike Bush did when Katrina hit and, I might add, looking very Presidential in the midst of a storm still churning now in the Midwest.

Now Romney will say he never said that, Romney cannot be trusted on any matter.He was horrible as governor of Massachusetts.He took money from fish and game licenses, and shut down a trout hachery. When confronted, he said don't fish just reproduce themselves. Why do they have to be stocked? He does not care what others think. He is a parrot, pure and simple.

Soooo, let me get this straight.  You say it is not about voting in a mormon, but about voting out a muslim.  You don't sound sane.  First others like you demonize the President for attending and being a born-again member of a Christian Church and now he is a muslim....no matter what he says or does....I guess until a couple of weeks ago, mormonism was considered a cult by pretty much every Christian standard and teaching.  We have been taught and teach that God's Word (bible) is inerrant and infallable and does not need any other document or book to make it real, valid or believable. So  how can you vote for a professed Mormon and a liar if you are a value voter.

I am glad they are finally killing gossip girl. It wasn't a bad show if you are into that sort of thing. But after everyone graduated from high school it became completely pointless. In the book once Blair and company leave for college a new set moves to Manhattan. Why is everyone so afraid of recasting? This is the same crap that ruined heroes. They have made me hate characters I once loved.
1
As much as I loathe saying Charlie Sheen was the star of Two and Half Men, he/his character made the show what it was.  Jon Cryer and Ashton Kutcher are funny in their own right, but the magic is kind of fading.  On a side note, they need another Star Trek series revive L&O LA or get another Law & Order or CSI up and running.  I miss Horatio Caine!

Finally! George Lucas is out of the way. Disney couldn't possibly wreck the Star Wars franchise anymore then Lucas has. I am looking forward to a non-Lucas Star Wars future. Lucas was responsible for terrible writing, horrible directing, and  bastardization of the brand through promotion of toys and products.  I was a huge Star Wars fan but the prequels made me hate Lucas. DIsney has what it takes to make this right. John Carter was well done even though it was not popular; but it is comparable to the type of movie Star Wars is. We have good things to look forward now that Star Wars is under Disney supervision.

Mitt Romney's campaign said he wouldn't do away with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, but it's unclear how a President Romney might overhaul disaster relief programs – a topic that was revived in the wake of Hurricane Sandy.\r\nDuring the GOP primaries, when FEMA was facing a funding crunch, Mr. Romney suggested at  that he'd like states to have more control over disaster relief funding and efforts.\r\n“Every time you have an occasion to take something from the federal government and send it back to the states, that's the right direction,” Mr. Romney said in response to a question about FEMA. “And if you can go even further and send it back to the private sector, that's even better.”…\r\n\r\n\r\nNowhere does it even remotely suggest that Romney would eliminate FEMA, as the left has tried to suggest.  \r\nEither you're for more Government Control of your life, or you're not.

Of course every idiot republican who has internet has some stupid remark about the Hurricane and the president. Wonder if you mental midgets had that hurricane pick up your double wide trailer and turn it into a twelve pack of canned tuna would you be singing the same song? We can make politics out of anything when it's expedient. Think about what would happen if you had disaster relief privatized? You morons would be filtering your urine through a coffee filter trying to make tea because you had to wait for blackwater to approve your credit application to save your arz. your candidate wants you sheep to believe the states can do it better, if thats the case you had 8 years to make that a reality? Plus, If this was such a good idea why hasn't it already been done. I hope it happens so  when disaster strikes you peni$ heads will have to wear grandma's panties like swim trunks and eat your fingernails for lunch. Good luch retardicans

The word "squaw" when used to denote a girl/woman is not offensive just as using the word "bitch" for a female dog is not offensive.\r\n\r\nThe following is excerpted from a letter that linguist Ives Goddard had published in the mid April 1997 issue of\r\nNews from Indian Country (p. 19A) on the origin and meaning of the word "squaw,"\r\n \r\nIt is as certain as any historical fact can be that the word squaw that the English settlers in\r\nMassachusetts used for "Indian woman'' in the early 1600s was adopted by them from the word\r\nsqua that their Massachusett-speakin  ​ g neighbors used in their own language to mean "female,\r\nyounger woman,'' and not from Mohawk ojiskwa' "vagina,'' which has the wrong shape, the\r\nwrong meaning, and was used by people with whom they then had no contact. The resemblance\r\nthat might be perceived between squaw and the last syllable of the Mohawk word is coincidental.\r\nSuch partial resemblances between words of different meanings in different languages are\r\ncommon and of no significance.

Emotion vs logic like political correctness vs truth and immorality have destroyed this nation.  I can't believe how many people in this country fall for a pathological liar as president.  He takes credit for Binladen so what, any sitting president would have done the same.   He is the most hypocritical president in history.  He has no integrity.\r\nExplain why he hides who he really is.  By the way What were the winning lotto #s when he was nominated for president and when he was sworn in?   Do the #s 666 mean anything?

Complete hysterectomy. Then make her get a job and pay for everything she got for free by having 8 more children when she could not even afford the 6..\r\n\r\nShe is just so ugly I can't imagine why anyone would want to watch her porn video.

Say what you will about Romney if you want to.  This is what happened in our area during last hurricane here in Louisiana:\r\nWent to sign up for food stamps and told that we made too much money to qualify for $200.00\r\n  in food stamps.\r\nWas told that we could not qualify for any FEMA help until we filed for insurance (no flood insurance)    claims first.  \r\nWas told that we could qualify for low interest loan from SBA and pay for damages not paid by insurance.\r\nNow if you still think that FEMA does not need to go, then think again.  Once again, low income trumps anything else and that storm was very selective and only damaged low income households.

Obviously if you’re attacking Mr. Huckabee for the ad then you don’t share a world view that is the same as his. I personally agree with him. As a Christian we should vote our values. As a Citizen regardless of what religion or lack of it you should vote your values.  Mr. Obama has not shown that he follows biblical principle and has continued to present legislation that is in the exact opposite of Christian doctrine. Obama is pro-Gay Marriage, Pro Abortion even to the idea of a 72 hour window after birth if the baby is born severely handicap. Obama has told trampled over the 1st amendment and acts more like a Marxist or communist than a free market president.
1
Huckabee is a complete idiot!  This is just an example of what is wrong with the entire fundamentalist movement.  They have themselves in such a box with no room for anyone who does not agree with everything they preach (whether they live it or not) that they are already in their own created hell.  They are all completely miserable and can't see any good that is going on in our world!

All of these repuke nuts are the same.\r\nAll pathetic, psychotic, braindead right wing radical cracked teanut dopes should listen to your leaders. They warned you about the Mexican Mormon Moron tax evading draft dodger during the primaries when they were able to tell he truth about this moron. \r\n \r\nLyin Willardo, the Mexican Mormon Moron tax evader, bankrupter, draft dodger, job outsourcer and Etch A Sketch Champion may have vision of going back home to Mexico. \r\n \r\nAll braindead pathetic right wing radical cracked teanuts should listen to your leaders. \r\n \r\nRick the Dick Santarium has brainwashed his followers, the evangelicals and the gay rapist, pedophile catholic priests that lyin' Willardo is a member of an evil cult and is the anti-christ. He also told them that lyin Willardo is the worst person in history to ever run for the presidency, can't be trusted and will destroy our country. Groper Nutquist, the boss of the right wing cracked teanuts and Nut Gingerhead, the criminal lobbyist, totally agreed with the last three assessments. \r\n \r\nSo most of the evangelical sheep will probably stay home on election day or some may even vote for Obama. They are totally scared to death of lyin Willardo, the Mexican Mormon Moron tax evader, bankrupter, job outsourcer, draft dodger and Etch A Sketch champion. \r\n \r\nIf this repuke draft dodger ever became president, and war broke out in the middle east, he will be putting his dog on the top of his car and fleeing to his birthplace in Tijuana and hide in one of his 4 grandmammy's (pappy's side only) outhouses.

It was always supposed to be a "trilogy of trilogies". I remember Lucas saying that back in the 80's. I'd LOVE to see the next 3 movies done by the same team that did TRON:Legacy. There's a numerically small number of fans that will complain...... but I really think most of us will enjoy some more Star Wars movies. They don't have to be perfect, but PLEASE make them enjoyable!!!!!

Mike Brown is a true, indoctrinated Republican puppet/mouthpiece...  ​  just like the jacka$$ that appointed him director of FEMA based on his resume as a glorified events coordinator. If you did a colonoscopy on this man, you'd find Karl Rove's fingerprints. \r\nThere are people in New Orleans that will never recover from the losses of Katrina and people who could have if it weren't for his incompetence and that of the Bush administration. Along with his fellow Republicans who would leave everyone in the wake of natural disasters on their own with sending FEMA responsibilities back to the states or to "privatization", he shows his true colors. It is yellow. He is a coward, when it comes to the citizens of this country, because the blue-blooded, greedy backers he has want him to fear the average working American with possessions and dreams like some kind of virus.

I am a Christian and I do believe Jesus died for my sins and I do believe every head will bow and knee will bend one day! I believe if someone chooses to not believe in my savior I have no right to hate on that person or demean him in any way I expect the same from them! I have strong opinions of my faith and do feel as a whole we are failing not making progress! I am not a fan of Huck and agree how can you say God will judge you on this vote when Romney is not in my limited opinion a Christian as per say I am! His faith and mine are quite different! I also believe the Church Obama claims to be from is just as bad as the Westboro nut jobs!! I hold an opinion on Obama as a Christian yet he claims to be one, to me his actions speak louder than his words! I will be voting for Romney and it is a choice of who is best for this country! I believe he is a better choice, Obama has failed and no one can deny that! The problem in this country is politicians on both sides have side stepped issues and taken on the role of leadership to be how can I keep my job and not whats best for the country! As a Christian it's not my role to be Judge or Jury I do know wrong from right and I think most folks do believers and non-believers just most folks don't own up to it for fear of being labelled! My faith will be judged one day and I feel thats a fact as will everyone! But as to how I voted on Nov 6 I do not believe in anyway God will judge me on that one! He may have said hey you picked the wrong guy but as for punishment NO!! I go by records and listen to plans and I believe Romney to be a good man and a sound leader and I want my country to go  on a better path than the one we are on right now!! I hate the way lastly our media has become a pick sides kinda industry the one thing in this country we should have is unbiased reporting of the news, just give me the facts untainted let me decide!!!! Right or left I don't care which side your on WE HAVE TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN OUR MEDIA TO GIVE IT TO US STRAIGHT AND ALMOST NONE DO!!!!!!!! WE WANT THE TRUTH AND WE CAN HANDLE IT TOO!!!!

FEMA IS THE TOTALLY INCOMPETENT, COSTLY AGENCY THAT SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN CREATED! Remember Katrina and the billion dollar, cancer-causing trailer fiasco! \r\n  \r\nIn the beginning, FEMA caused nearly all states to put an Emergency Management person in every county - a person with no qualifications for anything - thousands of more overpaid government employees who cost taxpayers dearly and added to Obama's increase in the national debt of $6,000,000,000,000 - SIX TRILLION DOLLARS DEBT DUE TO OBAMA and our terrible congress. \r\n  \r\nThree cheers for Romney! He said something that might get rid of worthless FEMA jerks.

First, educate yourself and learn to proof your work.  This country was not built on principles of free business, this country was built on lies that the white man told the Native Americans before they stole THIS country.  What I don't understand is why it is okay for the white people to lie for decades about what they do in Washington, but it is not okay for anyone else.  I personally do not think that the President is hiding anything, and if he is he learned it from American History!

i have 2 dogs- a border collie mix and 100 lbs of chocolate lab love (he's tall and lanky- not fat). The border collie mix is smarter than me sometimes. She can speak, shake with both paws, roll over, and will balance a dog treat on her nose until she's told to "get it". The lab is happiest when he is chasing a tennis ball, but will back up as long as you want him to, and he never seems to bump into anything. He also will speak, shake with both paws, roll over, and he is working on the "nose trick" as well. Amazing, aren't they??

Ok, here's your check." \r\nWell, here's your sign! You dummies or crooks. \r\nWe do not need more regulatuon nor bailouts. Let the damned RE market collapse.

That is everyone choice, but if you miss heaven what then? Obama has lied to the American people his record of doing against God laws? God is still on the throne and don't you forget this. If Obama get back in, God is allowing this for all the people like you have stood for killing babies, gays and lies from Obama. I told my husband  we will all have to suffer for sick ohs and be punished for soddish people. It wouldn't be nothing but right for those who do this, but innocence people will have to see America destroyed by Obama. God said it rains on the just and the unjust.

3/4 ths of the leagues players are black? I find that a remarkably low figure. But so what if one team is underrepresented by the number of black players on its team. Teams like the Knicks are overrepresented. Why aren't there more white players in the NBA?  I think the NAAWBP (that's the National Assn for the Advancement of White Basketball Players) ought to file a lawsuit and insure that there is a more equitable represnetation of white folk on the floor at all times. This story is bogus. Whiney a$$ black folk. No matter what you do for them it's never enough.

I agree with cancelling most of these shows that are so called reality.  I don't know what reality they live in, but it isn't mine.  Honey Boo Boo, Kardasians (I don't know the spelling because I only watched one show with my daughter and that was one too many), Ice truckers (really how many shows can you make of a trucker going across ice), pawn stars or wars, I forget which it is, and any Housewives show.  How bad can you get.  These are awful and don't serve no purpose.  I admit I like cooking shows, etc, but at least you can pick something useful out of it.  Although by boyfriend would disagree.

That's a bit insulting, don't you think?  She's not an idiot for checking herself into rehab; she would be an idiot for not doing so. \r\n Addiction isn't a matter to insult someone or laugh at them for their actions; I'm a recovering addict being sober for years with the help of Rehab and Narcotics Anonymous, and it's because of people similar to yourself that won't get their heads out of their **** and look at the situations with an open mind.  Rehab is for anyone that wishes to get sober or clean. \r\n She's had 14 kids total;  what do you expect?  I'd be asking for all of the Xanax I could get, too, if I was in her situation.\r\n \r\n No parent is perfect, and I don't disagree to the fact that the porn industry was a pretty bad decision on her end, but at least she's bettering herself by accepting that she has a problem. \r\n But that's just my 2 cents.

New Star Wars films will pale in comparison to LotR/Hobbit, and The Avengers series of films. But they will try to pump them down our throats; they will be overblown, and the nerds will unite to make it seem like Star Wars still holds water to the sci-fi/fantasy films that have far surpassed them.\r\n \r\nEpisode 5 is still great, but the rest are rather...hokey. How people can pretend they deserve to sit among the greatest franchises with only 1/6 films being worthy of acclaim is beyond me. But, fanboys will be fanboys.\r\n \r\nNOTE: "Classic" doesn't always mean "good".

Huckabee or should we say "Huckster" is once again exposed as the right-wing idealogue he is. \r\n The threat of hell-fire damnation to the ignorant and zealous provides an avenue for him to wring as many votes as he can for the republican party. \r\n Him, Romney, Boehner, all will be exposed next tuesday and repudiation will come for Obama. \r\n Clear headiness, tolerance, freedom of thought will triumph and he will hopefully disappear. \r\n Plus he sucks on guitar!

What the actual f**k?\r\n\r\nOkay, I'll admit, I've liked all 6 Star Wars movies thus far.  And I agree that it was time for Lucas to hand it over to someone else.  But... handing it over to Disney?  Three new movies already planned, with a new one every two to three years after those?\r\n\r\nSeems to me they are just gonna be going for quantity over quality.  And I would rather have one really, really good Star Wars movie every five years than a mediocre one every two years.\r\n\r\nUnless they film 7, 8, and 9 together, like they did LOTR.  That might work.

You better not vote for Romney then. He has been on both sides of all those value voter issues and certainly his Mormon religion is contrary to their christian beliefs.

what??  Um, I didn't say anything like that.  Why the ranting in your post?  I simply spoke about having GOOD values and acting accordingly.  You don't think this is important?  People who believe they can do what they want live in a fantasy world.  I guess you think you should be able to go out and kill whomever you please whenever?  I would assume not.  If you agree, then that means you have some values and morals.  By the way, when I speak of moral law, I am talking about good values and doing what is right -  not enforcing laws as in the government.  Heck, not all laws are morally right anyway.  In other words, personal responsibility and morals I speak of.

First let me say that Donald Trump is a rich man that is so full of himself, he is a joke!  I will never watch or support anything that he is associated with.  His ignorant  rants are overwhelming.  Why would he think that the President of the United States would have time or even care for his  asinine rhetoric.   \r\n And yes, he should donate that $5 million dollars to the people who were impacted by hurricane Sandy and keep his mouth shut.  He has plenty of Real Estate out East and has benefited greatly, he should donate at least $5 million. \r\n I detest his ignorance and the media looks at him as a joke as well as his peers.

No.  \r\n    EXCEPTION, n. A thing which takes the liberty to differ from other things of its class, as an honest man, a truthful woman, etc. "The exception proves the rule" is an expression constantly upon the lips of the ignorant, who parrot it from one another with never a thought of its absurdity. In the Latin, "Exceptio probat regulam" means that the exception 'tests' the rule, puts it to the proof, not 'confirms' it. The malefactor who drew the meaning from this excellent dictum and substituted a contrary one of his own exerted an evil power which appears to be immortal.    Ambrose Bierce, The Devil's Dictionary\r\nUS author & satirist (1842 - 1914)

Looking at the Dow, Dec Daily Chart, the 20 day moving average is down another 19 points, it's been averaging about 18 per day.  Both the top and bottom Bollinger Bands are now falling, indicating price should fall.  What I see from the formation, it hasn't made much of a Wave 4, should at least retrace to 13,155 (38%) before falling.  Commodity Channel is rising, maybe today it will retrace upward. \r\n  \r\nTrend is still a SELL, according to formation is ready for Wave 5 downward.   \r\n  \r\nDec Daily Chart in Crude Oil, the 20 day moving average conitunues to fall and both the Daily & Monthly Bollinger Bands are diverging, meaning Oil is definitely in a SELL posture.

I'm sorry, but Mike Huckabee (who I actually had hoped would have been the Nominee for 2008) has gone off the deep end. Support Mormons? Has he read their book? Or even the first 10 pages of it? Mormonism is a faith that has less to do with being Pro-God and more to do with being Pro-America. I don't know the writer's original intentions but when I started reading their book I had to put it down. It's literally about trying to claim the USA is actually Israel's Nation Brother and how we're both destined to last forever. A 100% contradiction of what Revelations states. I have no doubt the writer of the Book of Mormon was heavily influenced by his love for his country. And while that may be noble, Facism is not. And that's what the book of Mormon seems to be: Nationalism with approval being given by God for any thing that's pro-USA. It's a precedent already attempted by the Roman Catholic Church in the Dark Ages and will lead to NOTHING but pain.\r\n \r\n"Friendship with the world is hatred toward God." Any faith that endorses that much of a relationship between Belief and the Government (Or should I say: Politics) is NOT Christian. And it's a very, very dangerous idealogy to embrace. I find Huckabee's recent actions and proclamations over the last 4 years to be disturbing. As a Christian he should be ashamed of himself for citing that we must stand on a certain political idealogy. Mitt Romney is a Mormon. And even if he were a Christian, I fail to see any reason why I should vote for him on those grounds. His record speaks for him and it's bad. This year the American people are being forced to vote between two Empty Suits who promise nothing but more Government power. And Christians everywhere should be worried about that. Or are we trying to return to the days of Rome?

no romney did not want detroit to go bankrupt. it is called restructuring and a process by which companies can reorganize and cut the fat and downsize to save itself. after all, it was  the company that got itself into insolvency. what obama did was borrow money , money we as a country did not have and have to pay back with interest to the chinese. obama made this country weaker by borrowing from them. china is in a stronger position now because of obama's borrowing. \r\n \r\ngm did not pay the loans back like they said they have. they paid it back with more borrowed money. they now owe that money and we will get stuck with paying that off. you just can't keep borrowing because you continually owe. gm stock was 38.00 when we lent them the money. it is now 23.00 a share. another looser for obama, just like solyndra.. he backs losers and spends other peoples money very well. that is what he is good at. ..spending and debt.....

Romney is the biggest fraud ever to run for the Presidency.  He refuses to distance himself from Mourduck's disparaging comments about women, refuses to comment about eliminating FEMA and either privatizing it or deferring it to the states to deal with, has yet to comment on the JP Morgan debacle, has a tv and radio commercial running in Ohio that lies about Jeep moving jobs  to China.  This guy is not ready for prime time, not fit to be Commander in Chief.  He will say anything for a vote.  His views are all over the place.  Can you imagine if FEMA was dismantled and New Jersey and New York and the other states affected by Hurrican Sandy had to deal with the chaos of responding to a major disaster?   Romney will be a major catastrophe for this country!!!  Romney and the outdated GOP are a real threat to our Democracy.  A real threat to our way of life.  The choice is clear.  Vote Obama/Biden 2012.

Good heavens enough with the ignorant crap already. Read a freaking history book - this country was NOT founded on Christian values! Several of the founding fathers weren't even Christians, but Diests (they believe something out is out there, but that it's hands off and doesn't get involved). While I have no issue with your church, I'd suggest you get out of the sanctuary once in a while and crack a history book so you know how this country was founded. Oh, and the "under God" part wasn't added until 1954 in response to tensions with the USSR.

I hope Ohio votes for Romney, there is to much unknown about Obama. I believe he was sent here to weaken and destroy America. Just look at the slizzy people in his life. Bill Ayres, Malcom X, Bernardine Rae Dohrn, David Axelrod, Andrew Kaczynski, Carl Davidson, Frank Marshall Davis, Director Anita Dunn his Comm. Assoc. Patrick Gaspard White House Pol. Director, Jeff Jones, Van Jones, Rashid Khalidi, Mike Klonsky, Mike Kruglik, Khalid al-Mansour, Alice Palmer, Percy Sutton, Dr. Quentin Young life time friend educated Obama on Socialize Healthcare, Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright. Also some of these people are already planted in Congress & Senate.   Study up on these guys and you will see how Obama teachings had started out, Obama was hand picked since he was a young child to present to eventually being elected President of America. There are many scary stories and not something we would want in America. His first assignment was to weaken and destroy our finances, then move on to socialism and comminist ways.   PLEASE look up these people, this is a small partial list, each associate will lead you into another associate of Obama's. Past, Present & Future. If you don't believe me check his associates out. I did half the work by printing their names in my belief. See for yourself then make up your own mine.  An educated voter is very important. Don't let Obama destroy us. At least we know Romney is an American, and Romney is very proud to be an American. We need someone with background to get America back on our feet  Romney will not set us up for failure, its not in his DNA.  Don't let Obama's plan carry on any further. Obama  will destroy our Country it has been his plan all along.  VOTE Romney for President of the United States.

No....Although Romney is trying to use human suffering to further his campaign, I think that the American voters will see beyond this trickery and vote their hearts and minds....Besides, who could get used to saying President Romney????....It doesn't even sound right....It doesn't roll off the tongue...If he's elected (and that's a BIG if) I will refer to him as President Ramen Noodles....Which will be fitting because by the time he's done taxing the middle class, that is all we will be able to afford to eat.

Everyone out there that is going to vote for Mitt Romney I want you to go through history and take a good look at what I am going to write. Look at the Roman government 2000 years. They were the most powerful and richest on earth. They fell because the rich couldn't handle not being the top people in the government.\r\nThere was no middle class like there is today and the rich are trying to do away with it.\r\nRomney has more money than you and I could ever dream of or make in our entire life times. But just as the times of old He wants more.\r\nThink about His comments on the auto industry/ If the auto industry went under 85% of the jobs in America depend on the auto industry. Steel, rubber, glass, electronics, auto repair, and so on. With the auto industry going bankrupt as Romney himself said how much of the industry would have he acquired. He would be ten times richer then he is now.\r\nThe problem is when you open your mouth and stick your foot in it as he did you have to taste it.\r\nI myself am not foolish enough to vote for him. ARE YOU.

Anyone who has paid any attention to what the republicans have been doing can see that it is a disgrace. Anyone who listens to those lies and believes has no integrity, only narcissism. Only narcissists believe their own lies.  \r\n  \r\nRepublicans are a bad joke and so is religion. If they once again get control, the destruction will be much worse than Bush's reign. Sorry, but a full scale Depression does not sound fun to me, especially since the population is twice what it was during the last Depression. It would be a bloodbath.  \r\n  \r\nWhenever I smell a nasty stench, there is always a republican behind it. I need no more proof.

Is this about dance performance or a popularity contest?  I thought it was supposed to be about who was the best dancers.  I have absolutely no issues whatsoever with Kirstie but Geez Sabrina was let go last night and she can dance circles around Kirstie.  Also the judges need to make up their minds.  One dance their blasting a solid performance and the next their praising an iffy performance...I don't get it.  I think it is all a sham and it's all about money and ratings, NOT anout dancing.  I'm getting tired of watching this show that is supposed to be about who can dance.

I'll guarantee that Trump gives more of a PERCENTAGE of his earnings to charity than any of you do!! Do any of you give ANYTHING?!! Time, money, ANYTHING?!! And talk about "HATE"!! Really??!!  You people are saying that he should die a horrible death all because he has money and you're jealous! You're the SICK ones!! \r\n \r\nAnd another thing.......why is it that anyone who doesn't support Obama considered a racist? Are you kidding me?!! As if there aren't a thousand reasons not to vote for this man, you want to throw out the "race card"?! It seems to me the race card only comes out when you don't have a legitimate argument! \r\n \r\nIs the ONLY reason that you will be voting for Obama is BECAUSE he's black? And you're calling Trump selfish? You so desperately want a black representative in office that you are willing to let this country's economy crumble! And you somehow delude yourselves into thinking that this collapse will only affect rich people like Trump. WAKE UP!!

You can pick on Ryan Seacrest, but he is laughing all the way to the bank.  You can pick on reality tv, but at least it is not the same old script, with different actors.  You can see what is happening around the world, with these shows. Gold digging in Alaska, South America, and Africa.  Amazing Race travels around the world showing you different cultures and ways of living. How little people cope in a big people world, what people will do to survive nature, end of the world, and for a million dollars.  Homes being rented and sold around the world what you can get for you money elsewhere.  And much much more.  If you only stick with Westerns and Drama's you get no reality, like our politicians, and are unaware of what is going on in places other than your neighborhood and sometimes we just want to be entertained and laugh at stupid things, it beats thinking about work or responsibilities.  We have plenty of channels for everyone to watch what they like, no need to tell people what is good to watch and what is not.  If no one watches they will pull it from the line ups.

I am all for marriage between people that desire to be married. Like you christains actually stay together and don't marry and cheat and remarry (Gingrich). No christians get divorced or cheat or fornicate. No christians look at porn or go to strip clubs. \r\nAs for abortion. I am a man so it is not for me to allow women to decide my reproductive rights nor mine theirs. Let women decide what is best for their body. For fellas that are pro life, work on having a baby or adopting kids already here on earth. \r\naborted babies would live if it was Gods will for them to be here. If an abortion is successful it is because God wanted that kid in heaven right then. Its all Gods plan right? God surely would not let a fetus die if he had not willed it into being because he is all knowing, all seeing, all doing right? Either you believe your God stuff or you don't. Pick a side. Gods in control or man is in control.

It's always been known Lucas invisioned 9 chapters to his story, but saddly Disney has no rights to the 'real' final trilogy because it's owned by the author who penned it in the grafic novel 'Dark Empire Trilogy' after buying said rights to the story from Lucas himself. \r\n  \r\nEither way we'll see the events closing out the Rebel War. Something along the lines (depending on directorial oversight) Han and Leia snuffing out the remnants of the Empire while trying to get the Galactic Senate back on track to democracy, while Luke rebuilds the Jedi Order with the help of force aparitions Obi-wan, Yoda and Anakin (possibly even Qui Gon Jinn). If they stick to heavy detail of liscenced Star Wars storylines already produced then Luke will acquire a force sensative student who was once the assassin sent by the Emperor to kill Luke. She attempts to kill him after the Emperor's supposed death, but Luke turns her good. Fast forward the story out to the end of the Dark Trilogy, Han and Leia have 3 kids, the first 2 being twins. Luke marries his student and they have a child.

Buying home insurance doesn't solve the immediate problems of losing everything you own. It can take weeks or months to reach a settlement with the insurance company. Meanwhile, where do you live, what do you eat and drink, what do you wear? Yes, a minority of people will abuse the system. But most people in situations such as Katrina or what is going on now are most concerned about the safety and comfort of their families. And BTW, I don't think "common sense" had anything to do with the levees failing during Katrina.

I Think that this site is full of Liberal God haters who wish to continue to see America Suffer another 4 years of the same junk.  If the president can sit there and pick on Mitt's Tax returns who oh by the way we all get that same tax rate on our investments too.  But if someone brings up an issue against him they are just a bully.  Here's the bottom line this President has not fixed the issue in four years with Jobs and is just try to create a society of dependency.  If he is not getting the Job done then we as Americans need to fire him and Hire someone who can get it done.  And if Mitt Fails then guess what we Fire him in Four years.  If you and I didn't do the JOB our Employers hired us to do what happens.
1
I am a Christian and what Mr. Huckabee is doing is disguisting. I have to wonder did he read his bible. GOD don't need a spokesman, he can speak for himself. Jesus, when challenge by the Pharisee about giving to the government, respond by saying give to Ceasar what's his and Give to GOD what's his. He should encourage people to vote with the freewill GOD gave them, and been mindful to honor GOD by making decisions that demonstrate that we are loving our neighbor as ourselves.
1
Does Mike Huckabee know what Mormons believe?  \r\nGod's wrath... well maybe, but only if you vote for a guy who believes there are millions of gods, and that he will become one when he dies.  I am a Evangelical Christian minister; if I voted only for true Christian leaders, I'd have to write in names....

You remember what happened to a lot of aid money for Katrina victims? He is absoutely correct. This should remind those in charge of handing out cash to have some oversight and be responsible stewards of public funds. No foul on Kings comments.    Americans ..especially Obamas people, need more people talking to them like they are grown-ups instead of the dependant children many seem like they want to be.

I, for one, loved all of the Indiana Jones and Star Wars movies, and don't understand the hype about the "Crystal Skull".....(yes, Harrison is getting old, isn't everyone?) It was still a good rainy Saturday afternoon flick.... Since I am the kind of person that doesn't get attached to the outcome...I can enjoy the ride. It will be interesting to see what comes from this....and I will go see these movies and appreciate them for what they are.   If I find I don't like the film...I can always watch the "classic" versions on DVD, without feeling a bit pissy about it. Thing is I'm not going to sit here and whine about the new movies....there is a 50-50 chance they will be awesome, so why all the discouraging and disparaging remarks?

I'm against cancelling 2 1/2 men, but the writers need to step it up on the story line and involve the teenage boy more of a role instead of having him in the background.  Ashton cannot replace Charlie, he's ruining the show.

My thoughts exactly...\r\n \r\nChristians should be more offended by Mormonism than any other faith or religion the world over, because the Mormon doctrine is in a league unto it's own when it comes to blasphemy.  It takes the very doctrine and tenants of Christianity and uses chicanery and semantics to twist and distort and deceive.  \r\n \r\nIt's certainly worse than anything President Obama has ever said regarding faith.

A Republican will tell people to vote by their beliefs and a liberal will call them Taliban, but this same person will support Moore's video telling people to burn the country down if Romney is voted in. \r\n \r\nI find it very hypocritical that Liberals find anything anyone else says as hate or racist, then go to great lengths trying to show them as ignorant, but in the next breath will blindly follow liberals and support their hate, lies and deceit. I have never heard a GOP tell people to burn this country down. When a African American ran with the GOP the libs called him Uncle Tom, attacked any African American who dared not vote for Obama, but then scream foul if they see a little thing from someone else.\r\n \r\n“Maybe you need to pull that telephone out of your eye before you worry about a splinter in someone else!” Jesus Christ.

Disney has become a formidable production house and with the talent and licenses of Lucas films and ILM it will position them at the top of the heap.. Remember when Hollywood used to crank out original films and sequels at an amazing pace..  \r\n  \r\nNothing wrong with this move by George at all, in fact I think he is a man who has tried hard to give fans more.. Updating movies with current technology and tweaking his vision of the story.. Heck yes he made a lot of money and all those crying purists can boycott the new versions and live in the past.. I always thought it a fun challenge to pick out the modified bits in the rereleases since I watched the flicks 100 times.. The story could be spun out in a million different directions and fans have there own ideas on that so some will be amazed some happy some disappointed and yes some mad as hell.. We will have to wait and see but you and I know that all the loose ends in the story lines will never be tied up..

Are you KIDDING me?! Disney? No way! Disney can make "Bambi" just fine but not the beloved "Star Wars." I'd love more films, but not this way. Doubt I'll even watch them.

George Lucas has killed what he created. I hope Disney is given 100% control over the movie. Also, I really hope its not an animated movie.

Cancel all of them, even the Duggars, who are neighbors, with absolutely no negatives about them. They are a wonderful family, but Hollywood writers need work. I do not watch "reality" shows. they are the pits, what few I have seen once, and only once.\r\nI guess they do them because they are cheap to produce. And cable/satellite does not need a viewing audience since subscribers are paying the freight. Advertisers can get TV time cheap, even if no one is watching.\r\nBring the writers back who can write really interesting dramas and comedies. \r\nThen, maybe the networks will not go broke.

Our political system needs to be overhauled and overhauled immediately. We need to do away with the 2 party system and actually produce candidates that are capable of serving the people. Senate and Congress was not designed to make our representatives rich, yet our representatives have turned these positions into money making "cushy" roles. Lobbyists, PACS, Electoral Colleges, the whole gammit needs to be abolished and let people actually vote for candidates that do not have to be affiliated with democratic or republican conventions. Our public servants need to exist on what they have given the American people to exist on. Let them have to do with Social Security and Medicare and by God, we'd have a good system.

Sadden American, you do not have a clue. You are probably one of the idiots born rich and does not give a damn about anyone because you don't know what it is like to need help. I grew up in a single parent household and my Mom did her best to support her children. We were on assistance to have food and shelter.She was able to get on her feet and purchase a home for us. She provided love and instilled morals that I use to this day.I was part of that 47% you are calling lazy. I also served my country with pride for 25 years, in the U.S. Navy. My Country has given me opportunities to succeed in life. People that need help are not lazy. Their circumstances are different from yours. If you are an American, you would have compassion for all. You should have more respect for President Obama and not support someone who is struggling with their own beliefs.

There is nothing wrong with defending yourself against an aggressor.  You have to consider what would any person do if threatened?  There is only a big hype about it because Gene Hackman is a famous actor and the other guy is homeless.  Otherwise, it wouldn't be a news story. \r\n  \r\nPlus, I'd sure hate to be the homeless guy who claimed to the Police that he was beaten up by an 82 yr old man.  If you are so wimpy to get your rear end handed to you by a senior citizen you have more problems than you deserve.

"Can Gene Hackman be forgiven for hitting a homeless man?" Why does the media think that homeless people are bohemian free spirits, most are highly aggressive in demanding money and have no respect for others.

We were mugged twice in two weeks, we will never go back there again.

Jesus Christ your a long winded bastard, why don't you get up off your fat **** and do something to help instead of writing a god damn article on your opinion one one gives a flying **** about?

you people miss the point.  It's about getting big government out of our face.  Healthcare, education, gun laws, should be left to the states as it was written in our Constitution.  More Obama will only lead us closer to the U.N., and their proposed New World Order.

Thomas E.  What do you mean by saying "violent races are always going to be violent?"  Are you saying that Chris Brown's whole race is violent?

Anyone that has a job, should vote Obama out!!! (If they want to keep it)\r\n\r\nAnyone that doesn't have a job should vote OBAMA out.(He's never going to help you...unless you're a teacher or union worker)\r\n\r\nAnyone that's undecided now is mentally deficient

The Dow is positioning for a decent downturn.  The 20 day moving average continues it's downward pace at 20 points, and the Dec Daily Chart Bollinger Bands top and bottom are in a down turn, ADX is epxanding it's negative formation and the Slow Stochastic is near the bottom of it's run, meaning time is running out for it to fall.  The target area is 12,700, or possibly even 12,500, I would expect some large down days ahead. \r\n  \r\nCrude Oil:  Dec Daily Chart, this morning both the Daily & Monthly Bands were diverging, meaning a definite SELL position; they (both) have now switched from diverging to a flat out down turn, top and bottom bands, and the Monthly detemines the major trend.  Oil's going down! \r\n  \r\nI'm not sure for how long, because it's Slow Stochastic is also at it's bottom end but the Monthly looks long term; will have too see how it plays out.

If one storm can blow down the U.S. economy, what does that say about the fragility of the U.S. economy.  \r\n  \r\nAnd by the way, isn't this the same economy you were bullish on just two weeks ago? \r\n  \r\nI'd like to take this opportunity to say to the mainstream media that when there's nothing to say, you shouldn't feel obligated to tell me anything. Really, I'm OK with that.

I thing in lieu of the storm and power outages to over 8 million people they should have held off on the voting.   I do agree, its getting more like American Idol where talent doesn't really mean a whole lot.   Im done watching this as well.

That she still looks like a no talent hack

All of those guys juiced too! The only difference is "juicing" is no longer experimental. Science, well now has juicing down to a science....

No, not really...no one considers our Creator anymore and they are all listening to satan.  God is speaking!  He speaks to us through His Word, the Bible.  He speaks to us through the sky.  God sends the rain, thunder, lightening, earthquakes...no one hears because they are all focused on this materialistic world.  So many wondrous gadgets to distract, and they are all meaningless!

And they go after cyclists for doping. You can't tell me these men and woman do not do the same kind of doping. The human body is not meant to look that way normally. they have work out strenuously and quickly and be on some kind of protein diet and I have never met a guy or woman who did this for sport who didn't dope. This is just not that attractive on either gender.

Not happy to see what is going on with DWTS. Another American Idol! It's fixed. Sabrina definitely deserved to stay. She is very talented. Who is voting for Kirstie? It must be Max everyone loves! I would have rather seen Kelly or Shawn go. Shawn is stuck on herself and Kelly and Val should just go get a room already!  \r\nMy favorite is Gilles Marini, a real gentleman, and a great dancer and performer! And great Eye Candy for us ladies! Loved him the first time and love him again! \r\nThere is so much talent on that show, so let's get rid of the ones that deserve to go. Let's start with Kirstie! Why so much praise from the judges? Sexy - I don't think so!

I live in Washington state and it is on the ballot to legalize this year...with huge problems!! I won't vote for it iuntil they fix the bill. For one thing, most of the bill won't hold up against the Federal regulations. Part of the bill states it will be still illegal to posses it....The one big issue is the taxing!!! They will tax the grower to the processor 25%, the processor to the retail licensee another 25%, and the retail location will be taxed another 25%. \r\n75% tax will just keep people buying thier pot from who they buy it from now.....so it won't stop the "drug cartels" in the least....
